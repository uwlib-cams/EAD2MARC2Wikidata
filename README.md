# EAD2MARC2Wikidata
tools and workflows for converting archival metadata from EAD to MARC21 to Wikidata, and interlinking between description sets

## To figure out:
* Get corrected URI's into 856 fields in MARC data:
** MARC data as MARCXML
** OCLC numbers, Wikidata id's, corrected URI's in excel spreadsheet
** Could use XSLT/Python and MARCEdit? Emailed Benjamin/Theo
** Could use OpenRefine start to finish: emailed Thad
* Get Wikidata URI's into MARC data
* Push MARC changes to OCLC
  ** Junghae knows how to do MARCEdit
  ** Emailed Thad about OpenRefine
* Get Wikidata URI's into finding aids
** Conor, Eulie, Elaine

## Bonus points:
* Primo persistent URI's for catalog records into finding aids
* subject headings from catalog records into finding aids
