=545  0\$aThe World Trade Organization held its third ministerial conference in Seattle starting on November 29, 1999. It was scheduled to run through Dec. 3, 1999, but was met by organized protests, especially from labor and environmental organizations, and adjourned early. The WTO History Project and its associated archives are largely a response to the momentous protests that took place between November 29 and December 3, 1999 in Seattle during the World Trade Organization Ministerial meetings. The project also documents the lengthy mobilization that preceded the Ministerial. The protests were mounted by a wide array of groups and individuals, especially organized labor, environmentalists, and pro-democracy activists concerned that the WTO encouraged trade practices harmful to workers and the environment and operated in a manner which they considered largely undemocratic. The WTO History Project, a partnership at the University of Washington among the Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies, the Center for Communication and Civic Engagement, and the University Libraries, worked to ensure that future researchers of the WTO protests have documentation on the range of people who turned out, the varieties of strategies and issues they brought to the streets and the meeting rooms, and the coalitions they formed.

=545  1\$aThe national A. Philip Randolph Institute was co-founded in 1965 by A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin, in 1965 to forge an alliance between the civil rights movement and the labor movement. APRI is now an American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations constituency group, representing black trade unionists within the AFL-CIO. APRI-Seattle Chapter is dedicated to developing programs that will "extend democracy to those who have been traditionally disfranchised or discouraged from participating in the political system, strengthening political alliances needed to assure democratic social change and projecting social and economic programs that will improve the lives of all Americans."
=520  2\$aThis collection contains the office files of the Seattle chapter of the A. Philip Randolph Institute. The bulk of the materials are financial records, meeting minutes, and materials related to planning the chapter's annual awards banquet. There is also material related to other events hosted or supported by the Seattle chapter and various voter drive projects. In addition, there is a small collection of news articles and publications related to the local labor movement. This collection would be of particular interest to researchers interested in the general functions of local AFL-CIO constituency organizations and African Americans in the labor movement.

=545  0\$aAl Allen grew up in San Francisco, California, and entered a career as a longshoreman in International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, Local 10 (San Francisco). In 1959, Allen came onto the "B List" in San Francisco, working as a winch driver. The ILWU created the new hiring category in San Francisco--"B" men worked irregularly and had the dirtiest jobs, with the promise of promotion to "A" status after a year of work, and were not considered full union members until that time. Later in his career there, Allen moved into crane work. Allen was one of the original people to go to work at SeaLand as a supplement prior to the 1971 Pacific Coast Longshore Strike. During that strike, he served as a picket captain. While at ILWU Local 10, Allen also served on the Promotions Commitee. During this period, Allen worked in various different ports on the Pacific Coast, incluing Los Angeles, Portland, and Tacoma. Later, Allen used the ILWU transfer program to transfer to the growing port of Tacoma, where he became a member of ILWU, Local 23. During his time in Tacoma's Local 23, Allen formed a coalition with other transferred longshoremen from the Portland local (ILWU Local 8), and advocated reforms in the union's handling of the dispatch system and the qualification for the test necessary to become a crane operator--a coveted job. Eventually, these transfers from Portland and San Francisco began to reform Local 23's internal political culture, winning offices as the local's president, vice president, on the Longshore Relations Committee, as walking bosses, as clerks, and as crane operators--all positions of esteem and influence in the local. Allen also became an internal advocate for union militancy and policing of the contract and working conditions; filing and assisting other members in filing grievances. Allen was also involved in a gender discrimination grievance and lawsuit by Linda Nyland against the Local 23 and the Pacific Martime Association (the employers' organization). Allen later retired from ILWU 23 and remains living in Tacoma.

=520  2\$aThis collection contains photos and visual materials that chronicle the activities of Local 587 of the Amalgamated Transit Union. The collection provides information about the ATU 587 working conditions and internal culture. Of particular interest are photos from the first series, that date from 1916 to 1971 and are generally of the union's leadership, members, and workplaces. Most of the photographs from 1916 to 1971 were donated by August (Augie) Antonino, a longtime leader in the union and subject of many of the photos. Another highlight are the rolls of film and photo album pages on the ATU 587 No on I-695 campaign and the ATU 587 No on I-745 campaign.
=545  1\$aFounded in 1892, Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 587 is the largest ATU local on the West Coast. The local had 4000 active and 300 retired members in King, Clallam and Jefferson counties as of 2011. The main membership is comprised primarily of transit operators, but the union also includes 800 members working in over 80 craft occupations.   ATU Local 587 represents employees of:  King County Metro King County, Washington First Transit King County, Washington Solid Ground King County, Washington Jefferson Transit Authority Jefferson County, Washington Clallam Transit System Clallam County, Washington   ATU 587 has, as of 2012, about 4,000 active and 300 retired members spread throughout King, Jefferson, and Clallam counties, and is the largest West Coast ATU chapter. Also as of 2012, ATU International was the largest transit workers' union in North America, including over 190,000 members in the US and Canada.

=545  1\$aThe American Federation of Teachers, Local 336 is the oldest teacher's union local in Washington State. The union formed in 1934, in the wake of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933. Both NIRA and the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, granted collective bargaining rights for workers in most private sector industries but did not guarantee them for public sector workers. Thus, the members of Local 336 organized before teachers and other public employees were legally protected to bargain collectively. Local 336 was the first teacher's union in the nation to be recognized as the sole collective bargaining agent for all teachers within a school district and to successfully negotiate a binding collective bargaining agreement with the school board. The union was also called the Bremerton Federation of Teachers, Local 336 and was affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers as well as the Washington State Federation of Teachers.

=545  \\$aThe American Federation of Teachers, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO, was founded in 1916. At the University of Washington, Local 401 was established in May of 1935. Through the years of its existence it had voiced wider political concerns and developed policy platforms on local and global events, and defended academic freedom. Local 401 spoke out in defense of University of Washington instructors and against what they saw as unfair labor practices practiced by campus administration, particularly after various faculty were pulled into the Canwell Committee investigations. On September 20, 1948, Local 401 received news from the national office that it would, "cease to exist as an affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers."

He was stationed in the Philippines during World War II as a 1st Sergeant in a military hospital. From 1946-1948 Mink attended law school at the University of Washington and was campus organizer for the Communist Party, and a member of the Bookbinders Union. He moved briefly to Los Angeles to work as an editor in a small publishing firm and to conduct Party work in southern California. Back in the Pacific Northwest, Mink began a new career on the waterfront as a longshoreman and a member of ILWU Local 19. He was active in union politics throughout his career. He worked on the Local 19 Stevedore Safety Committee for 5 years and served multiple terms as chairman of the Labor Relations Committee. In the mid 1950s Mink broke with the Communist Party and helped organize the rival Freedom Socialist Party. In 1971 he was elected Vice President of Local 19. He died in 2011.

=545  0\$aAmerican journalist, author and political activist, Anna Louise Strong (1885-1970), who was based in Seattle during a formative period of her life, later lived for many years in the Soviet Union and China.$bBorn in Nebraska, she was the daughter of Congregationalist minister and pacifist, Sydney Dix Strong. Anna Louise was educated at Oberlin College, Bryn Mawr and the University of Chicago, where she received a Ph. D in 1916. Her father moved to Seattle in 1906, where he lived until his death in 1938. Anna Louise joined him there from 1916 to 1921, which was a time of radicalizing events, including the Everett massacre and trial and the Seattle General Strike. In Seattle, she began her journalism career and wrote for the Seattle Union Record. During this time, she was elected to the Seattle School Board, but subsequently recalled because of association with the Industrial Workers of the World (I.W.W.). In the wake of these events, Strong went elsewhere in search of socialism in practice. Her quest took her first to the Soviet Union, where she was based from 1921 until 1940. Strong also became one of the earliest journalists to cover the Communist revolution in China. She visited China first in 1925 and returned frequently until 1947. Strong's enthusiasm for the Chinese revolution may have led to her arrest, imprisonment and expulsion from the Soviet Union in 1949. After these events, she was cut off from the Soviet Union, shunned by American Communists and denied a passport by the United States government. She settled for a time in California, where she wrote, lectured and invested in real estate. In 1955, she was cleared of the Soviets' charges. When her passport was restored in 1958, she immediately made her way back to China, where she remained until her death in 1970. During the latter part of her life, Strong was honored and revered by the Chinese.

Since its founding, APALA has played an advocacy role around workplace issues of the 660,000 AAPI union members, serving as the bridge between the broader labor movement and the AAPI community. A constituency organization of the the AFL-CIO, APALA has more than 20 chapters and pre-chapters and a national office in Washington, D.C. Among its activities, APALA promotes political education and voter registration programs among AAPIs, and runs trainings to help empower and recruit AAPIs into leadership roles within the labor movement and APA community. APALA seeks to defend and advocate for the civil and human rights of AAPIs, immigrants, and all people of color, and continues to create ties with international labor organizations, especially in the Asia-Pacific Rim"--[Information from APALA Seattle website, 08/18/2021$uhttps://www.apalanet.org/about1.html]

=545  1\$aWest Coast rank-and-file members of the International Brotherhood of     Pulp, Sulphite and Paper Mill Workers (AFL-CIO) became dissatisfied with the     conduct of wage negotiations by international vice-presidents and those of     another international union, the United Papermakers and Paperworkers, with whom     a Uniform Labor Agreement had been negotiated. In addition to this     dissatisfaction, there was also a feeling that the internationals failed to     adequately understand and address local issues. In response they established a     new union, the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers, in 1964.     Litigation followed, and the records document this. A NLRB election was     conducted in October 1964, and the Western organization was certified as the     Uniform Labor Agreement bargaining agent. The AWPPW survived an attempt by the     two internationals to regain their dominance in 1967. As many of the mills     pulled out of the Uniform Labor Agreement after this, contracts were     negotiaited at the mill level which allowed for a greater degree of dealing     with local issues on a mill by mill basis.
=520  2\$aRecords of legal disputes surrounding the creation of the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers (AWP&PW), and related general union records from the pulp and paper industry. The bulk of the records are from lawsuits brought by the international unions after local unions in the pulp and paper industry formed the new union in 1964. There were two major cases. In Phillips vs. Perrin, before an Oregon Court, the international unions prevailed in reclaiming financial assets from the new union. In International Brotherhood vs. Delaney, before a Washington court, the local union succeeded in keeping its property from being seized by the international union from which it had disaffiliated.  In both cases, the AWP&PW based its case on alleged corruption of the international unions and lack of adequate representation in grievances and bargaining, reasoning that the international unions' rights to locals' assets should be forfeited.  Most of the information in the legal files is contained in a large volume of exhibits, which document internal union affairs and collective bargaining from the 1950s on. The exhibits include correspondence, meeting minutes, testimony of union officers, documentation of previous court cases involving the unions and numerous documents related to union democracy. The exhibit lists in each case file are the best guide to the contents of these. The court records involve pleadings, trial transcripts, and case notes. Partial records of a number of related cases from Washington, Oregon and California also contain testimony of union officers and numerous documents.  General union records include founding documents of the AWP&PW, correspondence, meeting minutes, and convention proceedings. Publications in the records include The Amplifier (1961-1964), a rank-and-file newsletter of the West Coast pulp and paper workers, The Rebel (1970-1972), the newspaper of the AWP&PW, and several works on labor relations in the pulp and paper industry. Collective bargaining records comprise minutes of conferences and contract negotiations of the West Coast pulp and paper industry in the 1950s and 1960s.

After attending the University of Washington, she worked for Boeing before becoming a secretary at the Northwest Labor and Employment Law Office (now the Legacy of Equality, Leadership, and Organizing). While at LELO, Sims became involved in Seattle's radical politics through her friendship with, and later marriage to Tyree Scott, the leader of the United Construction Workers Association (UCWA). In 1975, Sims entered the apprenticeship program of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 46 -- the same union that Scott belonged to -- through a court-ordered affirmative action plan specifically for black workers. She was the third black woman to ever enter the program, and the first to complete it. She left the trades in the early 1980s following the birth of her son, Seth, and later worked for King County's HIV/AIDS prevention program. Source: http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/sims.htm

She served on the Seattle Worthy Wages Task Force steering committee from the time of its start (1990). The Worthy Wage Task Force was coordinated by the National Center for the Early Childhood Work Force. until 1999. The national campaign, originally intended to last five years, was initiated to draw attention to the importance of child care work and the urgent need to improve compensation and training for child care workers. The campaign was highly successful in creating a network of individuals, advocates, parents. The locally-based campaigns such as the Seattle Worthy Wages Task Force provided resources and technical support, offered leadership training opportunities, and organized an annual retreat. Funding was obtained primarily through grants. Barb Wiley served as principal contact for many of these grants.

=545  1\$aThe Brand Responsibilty Project was a research project by UW Political Science professor Margaret Levi to document the campaign and dispute settlement between Nike Inc. and the Central General de Trabajadores of Honduras (CGT). Following the bankruptcy and closure in January 2009 of two Honduran factories (Hugger and VisionTex) that were part of Nike's supply chain, the CGT of Honduras claimed that Nike bore some of the responsibility for providing terminal compensation, benefits and priority rehiring for 1800 factory employees. The plight of the Honduran factory workers came to the attention of various fair labor associations and university licensing advisory committees, including The University of Washington's Advisory Committee on Trademarks and Licensing (ACTL) has commenced an oral and digital history project on the recent and historic ACTL. In keeping with its mission, ACTL proceeded to evaluate whether or not Nike had violated the university's code of conduct (that Nike is contractually obligated to uphold) as the basis for its advice whether to renew or terminate the University of Washington's existing contract with Nike to supply university apparel. ACTL was part of a campaign to pressure Nike to ensure the workers received what was owed them under Honduran law. The dispute was resolved successfully when Nike announced on July 29th, 2010, that it had set aside {dollar}1.5 million as part of a compensation package for the terminated Hugger and VisionTex employees.

=545  \\$aThe original union was founded in 1899 by railroad clerks meeting in Sedalia, Missouri, who formed an organization named the "Order of Railroad Clerks of America". The organization renamed itself the "Brotherhood of Railway Clerks", in line with other railway "brotherhoods" of the time. In 1919, it renamed itself the "Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employes" to reflect its broadened jurisdiction. In 1967, it changed names again to the "Brotherhood of Railway, Airline, Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employes", commonly known as BRAC. Finally, in 1987, after absorbing members from a half dozen other unions that merged with BRAC, the organization adopted its current name,  Transportation Communications Union (TCU).

=545  0\$aFilipino-American writer, poet, and labor reformer Carlos Bulosan (1911-1956) was active in California and Washington State as an advocate for improving the conditions of migrant workers from the mid-1930s to mid-1940s, but is perhaps best known as the author of America is in the Heart (1946).$bBorn in the Philippines (in Mangusmana, a small village in Pangasinan Province, Luzon Island), he began working as a day laborer at the age of eleven, after having received only three years of formal schooling. In hopes of a better life, Bulosan decided to immigrate to the United States, where he immediately encountered racial discrimination and harsh working conditions. Soon after his initial arrival in Seattle (in 1930 or 1931), he was forced to work at an Alaskan fish cannery for low wages. At the end of the season, he returned to Washington and became a migrant farm worker in Eastern Washington and California. During the years 1935-1941, he attempted to organize migrant workers into unions and began to write about their conditions, particularly those of Filipino Americans. Bulosan, who had published a poem in an anthology in 1932 and written for local newspapers and literary magazines, began to write more prolifically during a two-year stay at Los Angeles General Hospital for treatment of tuberculosis that began in 1936. During the 1940s, he began to receive more attention for his writings, which included two collections of poems, Letter from America (1942) and The Voice of Bataan (1943). The Laughter of My Father (1944), a set of short stories, further enhanced Bulosan's reputation as a writer and became a surprise bestseller. It was followed up by America is in the Heart (1946), a semi-autobiographical account of the Filipino immigrant experience. Plagued by ill heath, Bulosan wrote very little during the last ten years of his life and was blacklisted for his political activities during the 1950s. Following his death from pneumonia, Bulosan was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle; in 1982, an elaborate monument was erected in his honor at his grave.
=520  2\$aThe Carlos Bulosan papers are composed of several accessions which contain originals and copies of manuscripts of Bulosan's writings (including prose, poetry and some plays) and correspondence, as well as clippings, ephemera, financial records, a single scrapbook, and yearbooks for Local 37 of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (ILWU), which Bulosan edited during the early 1950s.$bAlso of note are sound recordings of reminscences and tributes made by friends and associates of Bulosan, including fellow labor activist Chris Mensalvas and Bulosan's longtime companion, Josephine Patrick. On the whole, the collection directly documents Bulosan's literary productions in greater detail than it does his political and social activism.

=545  1\$aIn 1969, Walter Hundley, director of the Seattle Model Cities Program, encouraged local black independent contractors to organize in an effort to gain lucrative building construction contracts that required minority participation. On May  27, 1969, sixty or so black contractors formed the Central Contractors Association, chaired by Tyree Scott (1940-2003). The organization faced 15 Washington building trades unions representing some 29,000 workers that, as of 1966, had only seven non-white apprentices, according to the Washington State Board of Discrimination. The CCA put aside litigation strategies and used direct action to effect change.  They brought every major, federally funded construction site in the city of Seattle to a halt in late August and September of 1969. They did this by disabling equipment, blocking workers from their jobs, and demanding that federal civil rights law be used to force unions to hire more black workers. In addition to direct action protests, the CCA launched a lawsuit against five prominent unions in Seattle.  In December, 1969, the U.S. Department of Justice joined the case in favor of the CCA.  The subsequent ruling handed down by Federal Judge William Lindberg found all unions except one in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The court required unions to open membership to African Americans, create a special apprenticeship program, change the admissions for journeymen level, and immediately admit 45 African Americans to the program. After this victory, Scott Tyree left the CCA to found the United Construction Workers Association (UCWA) in 1970. After his departure, the CCA decreased their emphasis on direct action and shifted its resources to helping provide training and support for black contractors who now had access to government contracts.

=545  0\$aCindy Domingo, along with her brothers and sisters, played a key role in the Asian American and Filipino youth movements of the 1970s, and has been a community leader in the Seattle area since then. In the 1970s, she helped lead solidarity campaigns on the University of Washington campus against the Marcos dictatorship in the Philippines. She was active in the Union of Democratic Filipinos (KDP), for which she did organizing in Seattle and Oakland. On June 1st, 1981, Cindy's brother Silme Domingo, a KDP organizer and union reform activist in ILWU Local 37, was assassinated along with fellow union leader Gene Viernes. For the next ten years, Cindy served as the National Chair for the Committee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes. The campaign resulted in the conviction of the former ILWU Local 37 President and family friend Tony Baruso for organizing the assassination, and also proved that the murders had been ordered by the Marcos regime with U.S. government knowledge. Cindy Domingo was an active member of the Washington State Rainbow Coalition in the 1980s, and served on the boards of the Church Council of Greater Seattle, LELO, and the International Examiner. She has been Board President of the Center for Social Justice and co-chair of U.S. Women & Cuba Collaboration, and currently serves as the Legislative Aide to King County Councilmember Larry Gossett.

He grew up in the Jessie Lee Home, Seward, Alaska, where his missionary parents managed an orphanage. Despite a childhood case of tuberculosis of the bone in one leg that prevented him from enlisting in World War II, he was a longshoreman in Alaska and San Francisco and worked on the railroad in Alaska. He studied at DePauw University in Indiana and the University of Washington, and practiced union, civil rights, and criminal law for 50 years before retirement. With law partner John Caughlan, he represented labor unions, union activists, the Communist Party, and foreign-born individuals accused of subversive actions. Hatten represented various people called to testify at the Legislative Joint Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities in Washington State (commonly called the Canwell Committee), including fired University of Washington professor Joe Butterworth. Hatten was also one of the defense lawyers in the later court cases for Albert Ottenheimer He longshored in San Francisco during WWII and later in the fifties. and Burton & Florence James (of the Seattle Repertory Playhouse), brother-in-law Ralph Gundlach (a fired UW professor), and Rachmiel Forschmiedt (a Seattle city sanitarian), who had all been convicted of contempt of the Washington Legislature for refusing to testify whether they had ever been members of the Communist Party. Hatten himself had been accused of being an active member of the Party by Moro Jewell during the initial Canwell Committee hearings. Barry was married first to Jean Gundlach, then to Louise Seifert with whom he had two sons, John Barry and Charles Theodore, then to Mary Telford Gibson. Barry Hatten died on August 17, 2008, aged 90.

=545  0\$aRobert Miller Smith was born in Seattle in 1938, where he lived his entire life. He worked for Boeing and then as a longshoreman/crane operator at the Port of Seattle and was a member of International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 19. Robert's grandfather, Charles Al Miller, was a foreman on the Seattle waterfront and a member of the International Longshoreman's Association 38-114. Charles Miller began working on the waterfront around 1907, retired around 1950, and died in 1968.
=520  2\$aThese materials appear to be ephemera collected by Robert Miller from his grandfather, Charles Al Miller, about the International Longshore Association (ILA), precursor union to the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU). Materials include the March 30, 1938 issue of the "ILA Bulletin" of the Pacific Coast district of the ILA. At this point, almost every former ILA local on the Pacific Coast had affiliated with the ILWU but the Tacoma ILA local. Another flyer published by the Pacific American Shipowners Association titled "Which Flag Do We Fly?" appears to be a critique of the ILWU's progressive leadership, accusing them of being communists. Other materials include two 1938 issues of the "Pacific Coast Longshoreman," a publication edited by Ralph Chaplin and aligned with the anti-Harry Bridges/anti-communist factions of the ILWU and the ILA. Finally, a photograph in the collection is of attendees at a ceremony at the March 2011 dedication of ILWU 23 (Tacoma) cemetery plot, which was part of Local 23's 125th anniversary celebration.

Wells also served as Secretary-Treasurer of the Rank and File Movement for Democratic Action in the late 1950s-early 1960s, a committee formed by members of IBPS&PMW locals in protest of decisions made by the International leadership, including the dismissal of Research and Education Director, George Brooks in 1961. These and similar efforts within paper worker unions across the U.S. and Canada resulted in the establishment of rebel union, the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers in 1964 where many dissatisfied members of the IBPS&PMW and United Papermakers and Paperworkers relocated themselves.

Born in Spokane, Washington, Castle graduated from Broadview High School in Seattle and the University of Washington but worked mainly in blue collar jobs like lumber mills, railroad yards, steelmills, shipyards and longshoring. Castle first became a labor organizer in the 1930s. In 1942 he was elected secretary of the Shipscaler's Union. After WWII, he organized lumberworkers and was active in anti-war movements. In 1957, Del became a longshoreman, joining ILWU, Local 19. He served on the Executive Board from 1963 until he retired in 1980. Following his retirement, he served as editor of the Rusty Hook, a newsletter for retired longshore workers, until, at age 89, he felt it was time to step down.

=545  0\$aThe Deep Sea Fishermen's Union was established in November 1912 to represent the interests of fishermen, many of whom worked aboard boats owned by others. Fishing was and continues to be a very dangerous occupation. Workers formed unions to help mitigate the risks of this dangerous occupation and to ensure that they were paid fairly by the vessel owners. The union represents long-line fishermen, those who use fishing lines and hooks to obtain their catch as opposed to dragging nets behind a vessel. Over its history, the DFSU has been active in the management of the halibut fishery, and were among the groups that helped to establish the International Pacific Halibut Commission in the 1920s. The union has advocated and helped establish programs of conservation and fleet management through government and self-regulation. In the wake of the establishment of a 200-mile offshore fishing limit in 1976, the DFSU continues to be active in that process of fishing and conservation. Because of this model, the union has evolved to an organization that is not only the collective bargaining agent of workers in relation to ship owners, but a body that lobbies for legislation and policies that are in the interest of its members.

Also included are pamphlets and booklets regarding radicalism, industrial unionism, anarchism, anarcho-syndicalism, Marxism, socialism, feminism, anti-war efforts, and anti-capitalism collected by Fraser (1905-1949). Personal papers include educational records; family memorabilia; calendars and diaries; and correspondence, as well as materials about cultural events that illustrate Fraser's wide range of interests.
=545  0\$aClara Fraser was born Clara Doris Goodman in Los Angeles on March 12, 1923 to Russian-Jewish immigrant parents, Samuel and Emma Goodman. Her father was an anarchist and her mother worked in the garment industry. She grew up in a multi-racial neighborhood, the East Side ghetto of Los Angeles, which Fraser described as a very poor, but highly political environment. While in junior high school in the 1930s, Clara joined the Young People's Socialist League, prompted by the despair of the Great Depression. In 1939 to 1945, Fraser attended UCLA and graduated with degrees in literature, education, and drama. She then joined the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party in 1945. After marrying at the age of 18, she and her first husband, Frank Krasnowsky, moved to Chicago. They then moved to Seattle to organize a Socialist Workers Party during the post-war era. Working as an assembly line electrician at Boeing, Fraser participated in the Boeing Strike of 1948. During the 1950s and 1960s, Fraser was very active in labor socialist politics. She worked vigorously to end racial segregation and the Vietnam War. She also supported women's rights. In 1966 when the Seattle branch of the Socialist Workers Party left the organization, Fraser helped form the Freedom Socialist Party. Fraser and other feminists began a Free University of Seattle class titled "Marx and the Women's Question" which was the beginning of the Women's Studies Program at the University of Washington. Soon after, she joined the original Seattle Opportunities Industrialization Center (SOIC) and CEP, the job training arms of the anti-poverty program. She became a consultant on feminism and race relations for many public agencies. In 1967, Fraser, along with Gloria Martin and the young women of the New Left, founded Radical Women. Radical Women worked with and supported African American anti-poverty programs, Native American fishing rights, and Asian American protests for low-income housing. After being fired from SOIC, Seattle City Light hired Fraser in 1973 as an education coordinator of the Electrical Trades Trainee Program for women. On July 11, 1975, Seattle City Light fired her, claiming that her dismissal was due to budgetary cuts. The Seattle Department of Human Rights, directed under Vivian L. Caver, a black woman civil rights and political activist, found that Fraser was discriminated because of her public affiliation with the Feminist Coordinating Council, Radical Women, and the Freedom Socialist Party. When the workers of Seattle City Light rose up against Superintendent Gordon Vickery, director of the agency, in 1974, Fraser was the leading critic and spokesperson for the massive employee walkout. She then became involved with a recall campaign against Mayor Wes Uhlman. A legendary case not only in Seattle but across the nation, Fraser garnered broad support from local and national labor, feminist, gay, and labor unions, women's groups, the LGBT community, and minority groups including the Black Panther Party chapters in Los Angeles and Seattle, the Native American Rights Advocate, and the Asian Law Association. In 1981, the court ruled in favor of Fraser, upholding protection for employees against sex and political discrimination. Seattle City Light was ordered to award her {dollar}135,265.00 in back pay, damages, and interests, reinstatement of her retirement account, social security contributions, and restoration of sick leave, dental and vacation benefits. Fraser died on February 24, 1998 in Seattle, Washington.

=545  0\$aEarl George (1894-1985) of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 9 (Seattle) dedicated his life to tireless work on behalf of the ILWU and progressive causes, most passionately in the struggle to end racial discrimination. George was born in Denver in 1894. He once said that "growing up Black in this country gives you a pretty good political education." Early on, the struggles of Denver's Black community and the violent Colorado miners' strikes shaped his thinking. George studied math and chemistry at the University of Denver before being drafted into the segregated Army in 1917 and sent to Fort Lewis in the Puget Sound. George arrived in time to participate in the Seattle General Strike of 1919. Sixty-five thousand workers in Seattle walked out in solidarity with 35,000 shipyard workers who were immersed in a struggle for wage increases. The action shut down the entire city. Like other African Americans, George was excluded from many jobs as well as many unions. In the 1920s and 1930s, he worked in a number of low paid, non-unionized jobs in the service sector, peppered with periods of unemployment. He found work as a steward aboard coastwise vessels, where he joined the Industrial Workers of the World, a militant labor union founded in 1905 which rallied under the banner, "An injury to one is an injury to all." When the Great Depression hit in 1929, George marched in Seattle's streets with the Unemployed Citizens League and the Workers' Alliance, an organization which fought to get collective bargaining rights for people working on Federal projects. He also helped build the Washington Commonwealth Federation and the Washington Pension Union, whose influence in Washington State politics helped pass the state's first pension bill in 1939. George joined ILWU Local 9 as a warehouseman in 1938. While working as a warehouseman, he continued to dedicate himself to ending discrimination and bettering the lives of workers. In 1948, he worked on a campaign that succeeded in forcing Seattle-area grocery stores to hire African Americans. A dedicated ILWU member, he participated in the 1948 Pacific Coast Strike, and in 1950 became the first black president of Local 9. While serving in local office, George and then ILWU Regional Director Bill Chester (later ILWU International Vice President) were among a number of African American unionists who helped found the National Negro Labor Council (NNLC). A powerful but short-lived labor organization, the NNLC focused its goals on ending racial discrimination in industry and racism in unions. They campaigned to get unions to organize black workers and were successful in getting a number of unions to call for non-discrimination clauses in their labor contracts. Earl George was a survivor of racism and also a strong combatant against it. Like many labor activists of his time, he also faced bitter red baiting. Along with ILWU President Harry Bridges and other members of the union, George was scapegoated for his political views. In the early 1950s, former Communist Party member Barbara Hartle testified at the Velde Committee hearings, part of the House Un-American Activities Committee, and named Earl and his wife Vivian along with over 200 other possible members of the Communist Party. Earl himself was subpoenaed to appear before the committee to answer whether he was a Party member. He recalled that "the committee was so self-righteous. They were going to save the world from dangerous folks like me. What did I have to say to them? I took the Fifth Amendment and walked out." Earl George was a friend to legendary performer, political progressive, civil rights activist, and honorary ILWU member Paul Robeson. In 1952, the Seattle City Council barred Robeson from performing at the Civic Auditorium. George came to his aid, organizing protests in Robeson's support. He took similar action when the US State Department revoked Robeson's passport, preventing him from touring outside the US because of his political beliefs. Lonnie Nelson, a longtime Seattle- area activist and member of ILWU Auxiliary #3 who was close to George, stated that he "was one of the people in the ILWU who represented a wide understanding of life and industry. He was a working class intellectual." George remained with Local 9 until 1961, when he retired from work. However, retirement did not mean an end to his commitment to the ILWU and labor and civil rights activism. As soon as he left the active workforce, George became a committed and active member of the Seattle Pensioners Association, where he variously served as Trustee, Secretary, and Secretary-Treasurer. George was integral in organizing freedom schools during the school boycott to protest segregation in 1966. He also became a well-known photographer, chronicling union picket lines, demonstrations, and rallies for social justice through his camera's lens. The ILWU International appointed him as a correspondent/photographer for the Dispatcher, and a number of his images appeared in the paper in the 1970s and 1980s. In an interview taken shortly before his death, George stated that "for ninety years I've been outraged by injustice wherever it rears its ugly head. All the movements I've been part of had one important goal: a little more bread, slightly thicker broth, and a bigger piece of the pie for everyone."

=545  0\$aGeorge Hammer was a lineworker for Seattle City Light who, when working as apprenticeship coordinator, developed improvements to City Light training programs in the the early 1980s. Hammer had spent almost two years getting reconstructive surgery after a 1978 accident that caused severe burns to his hands. He then had to fight to regain a skilled job with City Light. Hammer eventually went into the Safety Department, and then became secretary to the apprenticeship committee. By 1981, Hammer had been assigned to come up with specific recommendations for City Light's apprenticeship program. He researched and developed apprenticeship training methods that overcame some of the biases common in training methods in effect at the time, and which had the effect of making it extremely difficult for women to qualify. These methods were later adopted by the utility.

Krasnowsky was an organizer and health and safety committee officer for the United Steelworkers of America in the Bethlehem Steel plant in Tacoma, Washington. There, he worked with other union activists including Eugene Dennet to make the existing union contract more powerful for the union members at Bethlehem--particulary in regards to health and safety. At one time, Krasnowsky was married to fellow socialist Clara Fraser. They divorced, and she left the SWP to form the Freedom Socialist Party. Krasnowsky's mother was a Jewish and Yiddish anarchist and his father, Harry Paxton Howard, was from an old American family and a member of the Industrial Workers of the World. His parents met in Chicago, where his mother was a garment worker and they were part of the same IWW/anarchist circles. When they left the US together in 1917 for Russia to aid the Russian Revolution, and en route Frank took his mother's name--Krasnowsky--rather than his father's to allow them to get back into Russia more easily. Instead of staying in Russia, they lived in Yokahama, Japan for 4 years where Krasnowsky's father worked as an editor of the newspapers Russia Today and New Russia. Krasnowsky is also a member of he local Jewish American community. He co-chaired the Seattle chapter of the National Yiddish Club and performed as part of the musical duo Chutzpah. He is also the published author of short stories and poems.

A major subgroup of records reflects Miller's work in various roles in the Seattle Federation of Teachers, Local 200 of the AFT, including correspondence (1935-1966) and newsletters. A second major subgroup derives from Miller's activism in the Washington State Federation of Teachers and its short-lived predecessor, the Washington Joint Council of Teachers. This includes correspondence, Executive Board minutes, and convention records (1937-1966). Major subject areas represented in the Elmer Miller papers are Seattle School Board election campaigns, school district finances, teacher salaries, Washington State law concerning funding of education, collective bargaining in the schools, and the competition between the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers affiliates to represent teachers in Washington State. The papers include cassette tape recordings, with accompanying transcript, of a 1967 interview by Richard C. Berner and Steven Uthoff of Miller, describing Miller's early years in politics and the teaching profession in Seattle. There are also 6 sound cassettes of recorded interviews.

=545  1\$aRadical Women (RW) is a socialist feminist organization. RW sought to become the socialist wing of the feminist movement. The organization was founded in Seattle in 1967 when Freedom Socialist Party co-founder Clara Fraser and her close colleague, Gloria Martin, joined with young women from Students for a Democratic Society to build women's leadership in the left and anti-war movements. In 1973, RW formally affiliated with the Freedom Socialist Party, and the party gained a sister organization. Other founding members include Melba Windoffer and Susan Stern. RW is active in intersectional feminist socialist organizing against racism, sexism, homophobia, fascism, and labor exploitation. Their political analysis sees women's political action as essential in creating social change and trains women to lead these campaigns. They have been especially active in pressuring other feminist organizations into better representing women of color and the LBGTQ+ community.
=520  2\$aThe Radical Women National Office records (1976-1998) documents the activities of the national office of the organization, based in Seattle, Washington. They were collected and maintained by Clara Fraser, the co-founder and officer of Radical Women and the Freedom Socialist Party. This collection documents the evolution and collective actions of nationally recognized socialist feminist leaders from 1976-1998. The perspectives from leaders of the national office provides context to how RW has worked and grown their organization via the aid and creation of local offices. The records are especially valuable for researchers seeking to understand how radical organizations and movements evolve and shift through decades of adversity and pushback from the mainstream media and an inhospitable political environment. This collection provides access to communication among the local and national RW organizers as well as materials concerning mass work such as the protection of Roe vs. Wade, the Seattle City Light fight for affirmative action for tradeswomen electrical workers, the collaborative 1997 Feminist Brigade to Cuba, the landmark Freeway Hall Case, and drafts of RW literature such as the Radical Women Manifesto. Materials include correspondence, articles, newspaper clippings, press release materials, fliers, event programs, edited drafts and speeches, itineraries, legal documents, conference/event planning, and official newsletters. The content of the materials concern the organization's planned events, recruitment, and opening communication channels that are centered on social activism, intersectional feminism, and providing a platform for feminist speakers.

=545  1\$aGeorge Starkovich (April 27, 1922-February 26, 2014) was a senior gardener at the University of Washington and the local president of Washington Federation of State Employees Local 1488 president. He was very active as a planner and participant in the 1999 World Trade Organization Seattle Ministerial Conference protests. George Starkovich began working as a gardener at the University of Washington in January of 1965, and quickly became involved in an organizing drive on behalf of WFSE and AFSCME. Starkovich was an experienced union organizer who had served as secretary of his miner's union and shop steward at a plywood plant in Bellingham, his hometown. George served as a medic in the South Pacific during WWII. In 1954, when the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) came to Seattle, Stakovich was brough before the Committee. One committee member called Starkovich "The most contemptuous witness I have seen since I have been a member of this committee." Starkovich was cited with six counts of "contempt of Congress." In 1965 the UW hired Starkovich as a full-time gardener; he organized the UW gardeners from about 200 members to 1,000 members. Starkovich was repeatedly elected vice president and president of WFSE Local 1488.

In the interview, Andes claims to have witnessed Tyree Scott (later the head of the United Construction Workers Association, a movement to integrate the building trades) apply for union membership. The interview also describes his experience during a protest by African American construction workers and the UCWA at a Seattle Central Community College construction site in June of 1972. Site workers Austin St. Laurent (then head of the Building Trades union) and Mr. Andes were assaulted by some of the protesters.

=520  2\$aMaterials relating to the Electrical Trades Trainee Program at Seattle City Light and the subsequent discrimination case by most of the ETT against City Light. Also includes files on the history of City Light as a utility, ETT program head Clara Fraser and her discrimination case against City Light. The collection includes materials on the Employee Committee for Equal Rights at City Light (CERCL) as well as subject files on the 10 members of the ETT program. Oral history interviews done by Nicole Grant with Durham, and fellow ETT trainees and Radical Women members Megan Cornish, and Teri Bach are included in audio cassette and video DVD formats. The collection includes newclippings about Durham and the history of the ETT program and subsequent lawsuits.
=545  0\$aHeidi Durham (1953-2015) was a participant in Seattle City Light's Electrical Trades Trainee (ETT) Program in the early 1970s, and was one of the first women to be admitted to an apprenticeship program in City Light's skilled trades. When the City eliminated the Electrical Trades Trainee Program punitively for the activism of the programs director and the participants, Durham was one of the plaintiffs in a civil rights complaint which restored the program's participants ability to get skilled craft training and continued employment. Heidi Durham was born and raised in San Pedro, California in 1954, and moved to Bellingham, Washington in 1971 to attend Western Washington University. She moved to Seattle in 1973 and joined Radical Women, a socialist feminist organization led by Clara Fraser. Durham began working in the food service industry. In 1974, Fraser was tasked with creating a recruitment and training program for female electrical workers at Seattle City Light, the Electrical Trades Trainee (ETT). Durham was recruited in a competitive application process and, at 21, became the youngest of the 10-member ETT program. As one of three Radical Women members among the group, Durham played a leading role in the struggle for gender and race equity at the utility, where she co-founded the Employee Committee for Equal Rights at City Light (CERCLE) in 1983, and in her union, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 77. Following a landmark verdict on behalf of the women in January of 1976, Durham became one of the first women admitted to City Light's Line Worker apprenticeship program. Durham worked on the line crews until suffering a broken back in a near-fatal fall from the top of an electrical pole in 1977. Durham was partially paralyzed but fought to continue working in the field, returning to City Light as a Junior Power Station Operator. When she retired in 2004, she held the title of Senior Power Station Operator. Through her longtime leadership in Radical Women and the Freedom Socialist Party, Durham participated in various political causes. In 1984, Durham co-founded the Ad Hoc Committee for Fair Employment and Open Housing, which successfully organized community support to defend and strengthen Seattle anti-discrimination laws. Durham was also a writer. In 1982, she wrote The War on the Disabled: Adding Insult to Injury and co-authored Women Workers: Sparkplugs of Labor with Megan Cornish in 1990. In 1991, Durham campaigned for City Council on the Freedom Socialist Party ticket. That same year, she was named Active Advocate of the Year, along with fellow ETT pioneer Megan Cornish, by Washington Women in the Trades. In 2004, Durham was a member of the Seattle Organizing Committee for the Million Worker March on Washington, D.C. and was a featured speaker at the event. Durham died in August of 2015 at the age of 62.

=545  1\$aThe first printing union in Seattle was the International Brotherhood of Bookbinders (IBB) in 1900. Seven years later, the Seattle Web Printing Pressmen & Assistants's Union No. 26 was formed. In 1963, Local No. 26 merged with five other Washington printers' unions to create the Washington state Joint Crafts Council. In 1983, the IPGCU merged with the Graphic Arts International Union (GAIU) to form the Graphic Communications International Union (GCIU). GCIU branch 767-M was the result of the 1985 merger of PH & PPU Local 50, GCIU Local 26N and GCIU Local 530M. In 1996, GCIU Local 292-M of Portland, Oregon merged with GCIU 767-M. Additionally, between 2002 and 2003, GCIU branches in Bremerton (367-M), Olympia (182-C) and Aberdeen (262-C) merged with Local 767-M, further strengthening the Seattle branch.  The GCIU voted to join forces with Teamsters in late 2004, and merged in 2005, creating International Brotherhood of Teamsters Graphic Communications Conference. Local 767-M merged with Teamsters Local 117 in 2014 or 2015.

=545  0\$aThe Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) is a revolutionary syndicalist labor union founded in Chicago, Illinois in 1905. The goal of the IWW is to join all working class peoples together into "one big union" organized by industry rather than by trade. The IWW promotes organizing on the job to build workplaces that benefit workers and communities. In addition to improving the economic conditions of workers today, the IWW aims to establish a new world centered on economic democracy. As of 2018, the "Preamble to the IWW Constitution" declares, "The working class and the employing class have nothing in common ... Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth." The IWW is both a model for how a future society could function without capitalism and also the means to achieve revolution.

=545  0\$aThe Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) is a revolutionary labor union founded in Chicago, Illinois in 1905. The goal of the IWW is to join all working-class peoples together into "one big union" organized by industry rather than by trade. The IWW promotes organizing on the job to build workplaces that benefit workers and communities. In addition to improving the economic conditions of workers today, the IWW aims to establish a new world built on economic democracy. As of 2018, the "Preamble to the IWW Constitution" declares, "The working class and the employing class have nothing in common... Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth." The IWW is both a model for how a future society could function without capitalism and also the means to achieve revolution. The IWW established a presence in the Seattle, Washington area in 1905 and Wobblies (the nickname for IWW members) continue to organize workers in the Puget Sound region to this day.
=520  2\$aMaterials include subject files, correspondence, meeting minutes, reports, legal files, periodicals, and pamphlets created and collected by the Seattle Joint Branches of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) dating from 1890 to 1965 with a majority of the materials dating from 1915 to 1940. Subject files include bylaws, charters, reports, meeting minutes, correspondence, pamphlets, leaflets, and other materials relating to the Seattle Joint Branches of the IWW, other local IWW chapters and industrial unions, and the IWW generally; the Centralia Tragedy; the Everett Massacre; the Seattle General Strike; the Colorado Mine Strike (1927-1928); the Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti defense campaign; the Socialist Party of Washington Seattle Branch No. 1, Socialist Party of Washington, and Socialist Party of America; and the Workers Alliance of Washington. Also included are meeting minutes, reports, and correspondence of the Seattle Joint Branches, IWW General Executive Board, various local IWW branches, and the IWW General Convention. The collection also includes legal proceedings, court publications, and legal documents relating to criminal syndicalism cases in Washington, and the US broadly, as well as court cases involving members of the IWW. Periodicals and pamphlets also make up a large portion of the collection and include materials published by and about the IWW as well as other communist, socialist, and labor-oriented organizations.

=545  \\$aThe Inlandboatmen's Union of the Pacific was originally organized as the Ferryboatmen's Union of California in San Francisco in 1918. The union's early strength was among workers on railroad-owned ferries in San Francisco Bay, where it organized unlicensed workers, including deckhands, watchmen,     bargemen, oilers, firemen, cooks and waitresses. The union began organizing workers on river freighters and tugs, and in 1931 expanded into the Pacific     Northwest to organize ferry and tug workers on the Columbia River and Puget Sound. Its name was changed to Inlandboatmen's Union of the Pacific in 1936 to reflect this change in scope. Early bargaining successes included achieving an 8-hour day for ferry workers, and a guarantee of a "dismissal wage," (severance pay) for ferry workers to be displaced by the construction of bridges in San Francisco Bay. By the late 1930s the union had local organizations in Puget Sound, the Columbia River, San Francisco Bay, Long Beach, and San Diego. Since the 1960s, the IBU has had considerable membership in Alaska as well. Affiliated with the International Seamen's Union from 1919 to 1937, the IBU became the first West Coast affiliate of the CIO in 1937, and was affiliated with the Maritime Federation of the Pacific in the 1930s. Leaving the CIO in 1948, the IBU was affiliated with the Seafarers' International Union of North America until 1979. Since October 31, 1980 the IBU has been the Marine Division of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union.

=520  2\$aPDF of article written by Peter Costantini in 2000, and revised to include citations in 2005 and 2017.  The article is about Ship Scalers, Dry Dock & Miscellaneous Boat Yard Workers Union, Local 541 and its battle with its international union, the Laborers' International Union of North America. In the late 1970s, disaffected rank-and-file members created a reform movement. In 1980, its leaders were elected to change the local union. Local leaders continued to battle with the LIUNA International leadership until the International took jurisdiction over all the major shipyards away from the Seattle local and gave it to Local 252 in Tacoma. This was possible because contracts for these yards were negotiated by the International rather than the Local. This effectively ended Local 541.

=545  1\$aSeattle Opportuities Industrialization Center (often refered to as "SOIC") was incorporated in May 1966 as a private, nonprofit community-based vocational training center. It was founded as an outgrowth of the OIC movement which had been started two years earlier in Philadelphia. In 1972 Seattle Opportuities Industrialization Center became the first community-based organization to receive federal designation as a Skills Center. Its rapid growth and expanding programs made possible the building of a multi-million dollar training center dedicated in 1974. Seattle Opportuities Industrialization Center's diversified funding and its accreditation saved the school from the financial collapse experienced at the beginning of the 1980s by many similar institutions, but it could not survive the federal government's rapid and drastic cutback of funding around 1983 and 1984. It attempted to continue its services by totally reorganizing its service delivery system. Efforts continued another two years but on September 25, 1986 a Chapter 11 bankruptcy notice was filed.

=545  1\$a"The first pensions dispensed to retiring longshore workers, members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, were issued in July 1952. Soon after retiring, many of this first wave of ILWU pensioners organized into regional clubs on the West Coast. At first, they served mainly as fraternal organizations for retired ILWU members and partners to socialize. Soon, however, the activist culture of the ILWU became evident and the clubs began to take action on senior citizens' issues, labor problems and matters relating to the ILWU locals from which they retired. In 1968 those regional ILWU pensioner clubs formed the coastwide Pacific Coast Pensioners Association, calling an organizing convention in September of 1968 with the goal of founding a fraternal organization of ILWU pensioners that would allow them to act with unity as an advocacy as well as a social organization, their official motto becoming "Retired from the Job But Not From the Struggle". The PCPA holds an annual convention at a port on the West Coast, with the location changing every year. They also have the unusual position within union retiree organizations of having a member on the ILWU's contract negotiation team during the collective bargaining process to ensure the concerns of retired members are addressed"-- https://www.ilwu.org/why-the-pacific-coast-pensioners-association

Project files also include some brief video clips of ILWU pickets and actions and short anecdotes taken by historian Ron Magden, who also did many of the oral histories. ILWU oral historian Harvey Schwartz performed the rest of the interviews.

=545  0\$aSeattle attorney and civil rights leader John Caughlan (1909-1999) was a champion of civil liberties and human rights over the course of a long career.$bCaughlan was born in Missouri, but moved with his family to Eastern Washington in 1911, before settling in Seattle. He attended the University of Washington as an undergraduate and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1935. He returned to Seattle after a short stint in New York. In 1938, Caughlan became a deputy prosecutor for King County, but he eventually was dismissed for refusing to publicly denounce the Soviet Union. During this period, he independently represented CIO official, Dick Law, at the inquest into the death of his wife, Laura Law. Caughlan spent the rest of his career in private practice. During the 1940s and 1950s, he represented labor unions, union activists, the Communist Party, foreign-born residents facing deportation because of their political activities, and individuals accused of "subversive" or "un-American" activities. Among these clients were Hazel Wolf, as well as a number of witnesses before the hearings conducted by the Washington State Legislature's Joint Legislative Fact Finding Committee on Un-American Activities, led by Albert F. Canwell, in 1947-1948. In the 1960s and 1970s, Caughlan's focus moved to segregation and racial discrimination, and human rights beyond the United States. Human rights abuses by governments supported by the United States would remain an issue of ongoing concern for Caughlan. In 1977, he went to the Philippines as part of a delegation headed by former United States Attorney General Ramsey Clark, on a fact-finding mission to investigate human rights violations by the Marcos regime. During the 1980s, he travelled several times to Central America, particularly Nicaragua, participating in a National Lawyers Guild mission in 1984 to observe the Nicaraguan elections, and also represented Central American refugees in their immigration cases. After the 1981 murders of Filipino union organizers and anti-Marcos activists Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes, Caughlan was part of the legal team which represented the families in a civil suit against Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos and the Republic of the Philippines. Caughlan was also much concerned with nuclear power issues and later became very involved with the Line of March. Other organizations with which Caughlan was active included the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington, the National Lawyers Guild, and the Seattle chapter of the National Lawyers Guild. Caughlan died on April 17, 1999.
=520  8\$aThe John Caughlan papers primarily document the activities of the Seattle lawyer and activist through case files (which frequently include correspondence, newsletters, pleadings, and reports) representing a comprehensive range of the causes with which he was involved from the 1930s through the 1990s.$bSignificant legal cases include: the Smith Act case of United States vs. Henry Huff, the Canwell hearings, Richard Law murder defense, Marine Cooks and Stewards Union, Washington Pension Union, Domingo et al. vs. Ferdinand Marcos et al., conscientious objector cases, and cases involving members of the Black Panthers (including Elmer Dixon). Also included is additional material related to Caughlan's work on behalf of clients called to testify in the Canwell Committee hearings. Subject files document his interest in, and visits to, Central America and the Philippines. Related organizations' records show his involvement with the National Lawyers Guild, both on the national and local levels.

=545  0\$aJoseph P. "Joe" Clancy was born in Montana in 1896. He was Secretary of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders and Helpers of America, Local 104, in Seattle, Washington from 1941 to 1972. In 1946, tensions escalated between International President Charles J. MacGowan and members of Local 104 after the president attempted to take control of the Local through an appointed board of governors. Clancy and fellow officer Bill Miller were subsequently tried and suspended from the local after refusing to turn over Local 104's funds, newspaper, and records to MacGowan. Initially MacGowan's actions were upheld after the case was first taken to the Seattle superior court by members of the local; however, this decision was reversed several years later by the Washington State Supreme Court. The local was given back control over elections of officers, and Clancy was re-elected to Local 104 in the mid-1950s. Clancy passed away in 1973 shortly after finishing his term as union secretary in 1972.
=520  2\$aThe Joseph Clancy papers span the years 1921-1972 and contain records related to Clancy's work as Secretary of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders and Helpers of America, Local 104 in Seattle, Washington. A majority of the materials pertain to International President MacGowan's efforts to take control of Local 104 and the trial and suspension of Clancy and Bill Miller from the union. Also included are records related to the activities of Local 72 in Portland, Oregon. The collection also contains a scrapbook, likely compiled by Clancy, containing news clippings, photographs, correspondence, election materials, printed materials, and ephemera related to the IBB. Loose materials previously folded into the scrapbook were removed for preservation reasons, placed in folders, and housed with the other foldered materials. This is denoted in the folder titles for these materials.

=545  0\$aPotenciano Parin Columna was born on May 19, 1905 in General Trias, Cavite, Philippines. He often went by "Parin Colombo." Columna traveled to the United States in 1924, eventually moving to Los Angeles after brief stays in Vancouver, Seattle and New York. In 1933, Columna earned his pilot's license, becoming the first Filipino pilot in the United States. During World War II, Columna served in the armed forces as a technician overseas. He was also a long-term member of the Caballeros de Dimas-Alang, a fraternal organization in the Filipino community and filled many important leadership roles. When Carlos Bulosan, a noted Filipino novelist, poet and labor activist, was ill with tuberculosis and receiving treatment at the Los Angeles County Sanitarium (now the USC Medical Center), Columna and the Caballeros raised funds to help cover Bulosan's medical costs and try to send Bulosan back to the Philippines to recover. Columna also acted as the manager of The Luau, a Polynesian restaurant in Beverly Hills where he frequently hired Filipino immigrants, often for their first jobs in the United States. He acted as a benefactor for several Filipino students as they made their way through college, continuing to be an important leader in the Los Angeles Filipino community until his death on January 7, 1997.

=545  1\$aElmer Smith, who is documented in this collection, was a progressive lawyer in Centralia, Washington who defended the Industrial Workers of the World members arrested following the Centralia Tragedy of 1919. Smith was a high school teacher before becoming an attorney. As an attorney he represented IWW members, loggers and miners. After hearing rumors of a planned attack on their IWW meeting hall, several Wobblies consulted with Smith about whether they had a right to defend themselves and their hall. Their previous hall had been attacked the year before during a parade. Smith contacted Washington's governor and the IWW's asked for protection from Centralia law enforcement. However, both attempts were denied as were IWW member efforts to plead for justice from town residents. Smith then advised the Wobblies it would be legal to physically defend themselves if attacked first. On November 11th, 1919, under the guise of an Armistice Day Parade, American Legionnaires attacked the Centralia IWW hall. IWW members shot and killed four Legionnaires during the attack and wounded several others. A posse later mistakenly killed one of their own. IWW member Wesley Everest fled the scene, killing one of the men pursuing him, and was put in jail. That night, he was pulled from his cell by a group of vigilantes and lynched on a bridge above the Chehalis River. Ten men, including Smith, were arrested and tried for murder during a trial that was heavy with fear and intimidation. Seven men were found guilty and one was judged insane. Smith was acquitted and spent the rest of his life advocating for their release. He was harassed, arrested and disbarred for his work. He was reinstated before he died.

=520  2\$aThis collection contains Tom Copeland's research materials on Elmer Smith, attorney for the Industrial Workers of the World involved in the Centralia Tragedy of 1919. These materials were used by Copeland in the writing of his book, The Centralia Tragedy of 1919: Elmer Smith and the Wobblies (1993). Also included are research materials from his 1986 article, "Wesley Everest, IWW Martyr" published in The Pacific Northwest Quarterly. As a part of his research, Copeland conducted a series of oral history interviews with Centralia residents in the 1970s, including members of Smith's family, IWW members, classmates, and others who knew him. Collection contents include Copeland's research notes as well as reproductions and originals gathered by Copeland from family members and archival repositories of news and magazine clippings, pamphlets, correspondence, and other primary sources, including papers and photographs from Elmer and the Smith family. The collection also contains several scholarly papers and manuscripts, including a draft with notes from Virginia Waddell, Smith's daughter, of her in-progress biography of her father. Other research materials include correspondence between Copeland and people who knew Smith as well as a large series of oral history interview materials, including correspondence between Copeland and interviewees, paper and digital copies oftranscriptions of some of the interviews, and analog and digital audiorecordings of many of the interviews. See the Arrangement Note for a full list of series and subseries. More detailed description of each series is also included in the collection inventory, integrating Tom Copeland's notes on the collection when available

=545  0\$aMegan Cornish was born in 1947 into a military family and grew up in various locations around the United States. After graduating from Cornell University in 1969 with a BA in literature, Cornish moved to the Puget Sound region and worked at The Shelter Half, an anti-war GI coffeehouse in Tacoma. In her early years in the Pacific Northwest, Cornish was not a member of a formal group or organization. However, Cornish joined Radical Women after being drawn to the group's intersectional approach and became more interested in labor organizing. She took a job at a nursing home and also briefly worked in an industrial laundry facility.  In 1974, Cornish was recruited by Clara Fraser, a cofounder of Radical Women and education coordinator at Seattle City Light, to apply for a position as an Electrical Trades Trainee (ETT), an all-female affirmative action program designed by Fraser to integrate women into the electrical trades. Cornish was selected to be one of ten women ETT's out of an application pool of over 300. In the first weeks on the job, the sense of solidarity between workers as the result of a walkout that occurred just weeks before caused Cornish and the other female ETT's to be received well. The shared resentment towards City Light Superintendent Gordon Vickery and management created a sense of unity amongst the electrical workers and reduced their hostility towards their new female coworkers. The severed relationship between Fraser and management, however, left the ETT's in a highly vulnerable position as management sought to retaliate against Fraser through damaging the ETT program.  Only a week after starting, the ETT training program was canceled and Fraser was removed from her position as the training coordinator. Trainees were told on a Friday afternoon to report to field work the next week, where they made {dollar}1 less per hour than the other electrical helpers. In response, the ETT's filed a complaint with the City of Seattle Office of Women's Rights (OWR) stating that they were being denied the typical amount of training and pay reserved for male employees. After a year of training, Cornish and seven of the other ETT's were laid off, along with Fraser. The ETT's and Fraser saw their terminations as politically motivated and retaliatory, and they added the lay-offs to their OWR complaint.  As their case was being reviewed, the former ETT's engaged in a massive public relations campaign to win the support of the public. Numerous articles about the case were published in the local press, and the case became a central focus of the local women's movement. In July 1976, in a major victory, City Light was ordered to reinstate six of the terminated trainees, including Cornish, as well as to pay a settlement, give them back pay, and make them eligible for apprenticeship programs.  After the victorious court ruling, Cornish applied for a City Light apprenticeship as a lineworker, along with two other Radical Women members Teri Bach and Hildreth (Heidi) Durham. Cornish described this period as the "roughest" time during her career at City Light. Vickery and management, angered by the ruling, placed Cornish and her female colleagues into positions that were designed to be the most difficult to succeed in. Each of the women were placed into divisions that were known to be hostile to them, which ultimately led to Durham falling from a pole and breaking her back in a near fatal accident.  In addition to being antagonized by management, Cornish and the other women apprentices were also met with animosity from the male electrical workers that they worked alongside. In 1975, Local 77 of the IBEW staged a failed strike that led to harsher working conditions. Many male electricians, frustrated and demoralized by their strike's defeat, held resentment towards the former ETT's for winning their discrimination case, and these feelings were exploited by management to increase the sexist hostility of the work environments.  Despite having an affirmative action plan to diversify its workforce, Cornish, Bach, and Durham remained some of the only female electrical workers at City Light for nearly ten years. The three regularly gave public comment at Seattle City Council meetings to demand the hiring of more women and people of color at City Light. In the early 1980's, City Light hired its first new female electrical worker in nearly a decade.  In 1983, Cornish helped establish the Employee Committee for Equal Rights at City Light (CERCL) to fight workplace harassment and discrimination in response to inaction from management, union leaders, and the City of Seattle Human Rights Department (HRD). CERCL membership grew rapidly in the mid-1980's and pressured the HRD to investigate discrimination cases. In 1991, Cornish and Durham were jointly named Advocate of the Year by the Washington Women in the Trades.  Cornish retired from Seattle City Light in 2004 after 30 years. At the time of her retirement, she held the position of outage dispatcher, the highest position in the utility trades. She credits her adherence to feminism and political radicalism as essential to her successful accomplishments in her organizing at City Light. She remains an active member of Radical Women and the Freedom Socialist Party and continues to write for the Freedom Socialist newspaper.   Adapted from the Megan Cornish article on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Cornish
=520  2\$aThis collection contains records collected by Megan Cornish as one of the first female electricians at Seattle City Light between 1970 and 2003. The materials span from her apprenticeship in the Electrical Trades Trainee (ETT) affirmative action program until her retirement from Seattle City Light as a senior power dispatcher. Cornish helped found the Employee Committee for Equal Rights at City Light (CERCL) to fight race and sex discrimination within the agency. Much of the material is related to a series of discrimination lawsuits filed by Cornish and other members of the Freedom Socialist Party (FSP) and Radical Women, including Clara Fraser, Teri Bach, and Hildreth (Heidi) Durham.   There is also material related to Cornish's involvement and organizing efforts in her union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), Local 77, and other unions including the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), Local 17. These records contain meeting minutes, legal briefings and reports, worker testimonies; materials from other discrimination lawsuits; City of Seattle employee memorandums; correspondence; employee evaluations and documentations; City Light job postings; negotiated union contracts; Cornish's union cards and dues statements; leaflets; newsletters; and news articles related to Cornish's activities at City Light. This collection would be of particular interest to those interested in women in the labor movement, labor unions, feminism, socialism, affirmative action, discrimination, sexism, labor law, and organizing in the public sector.

=545  0\$aWilliam John (Bill) Corr (1906-1984) and his wife, Cecilia Genevieve Brodine Corr (1914-2006), were activists in Seattle interested in socialism, labor, civil rights, and the environment. Cecilia Corr was also an artist.  Bill was born in New York City to Irish immigrant parents. Leaving school after the 8th grade, he eventually became a union organizer and a member of the Communist party. He met Cecilia, daughter of Swedish immigrants living in Seattle, when she visited her brother Franz, who was Bill's roommate. After marrying in 1936, Bill and Cecilia moved to Seattle to raise their family of four sons.  Bill worked as a circulation manger for the Washington New Dealer for a short time, resigning in 1939. During World War II he worked as a welder and was an active unionizer until his communist associations were revealed in the 1950s. From that time on, he worked as small business contractor and engaged in environmental activism, notably serving as Acting Chairman in the Save Cypress Island Committee in the 1960s and 1970s. Cecilia contributed to this effort, producing a block print for Heritage & Legacy: The Story of the Cypress Island Co-operative.  Cecilia's participation in peace efforts and civil rights also included involvement with the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), Citizens' Train, Washington State Council of American-Soviet Friendship, and the Washington Committee to Protect the Foreign Born. During the late 1950s , Cecilia wrote to US congresspeople on a wide range of issues. Cecilia contributed to her activism through her artistic skills, illustrating newsletters for the Washington State Council of American-Soviet Friendship, for which she served as co-editor in the late 1980s, and creating other political sketches. She also worked for the University of Washington as an illustrator during 1959 and 1960.

=545  0\$aRichard V. "Dick" Correll (1904-1990), described as "one of the leading masters of printmaking in the West", was best known for his powerful black and white linoleum cuts, etchings and woodblock prints. For most of his life he earned a living as a commercial artist in the book publishing and advertising fields while producing a large body of fine art in his own time. His themes ranged from landscapes, animals and agricultural scenes, harbors and ships, and music and dance to those which reflected his lifelong concern with political and social issues. As one curator wrote, "the maturity of his technique, with its rich textures and dramatic contrasts, combines with a wide range of subject matter to produce a body of work of great warmth, power, and depth". Correll stated that, above all, he was a humanist.Born in Missouri 1904, Richard Correll spent most of his life in the three West Coast states, spending his early years in small farms or towns in Oregon and California. He absorbed his intellectual thirst -- and the craft of fine woodworking - from his father, a lawyer, school teacher, master carpenter, and voracious reader, and the love of art and music from his mother, a musician trained at Oberlin. A natural artist from early childhood, by the age of four Dick was cutting perfect farm animals out of paper with his mother's sewing scissors. He was largely self-taught: "I combed the library of every place we moved to for reproductions and critical articles on artwork or artists.  I am a constant student." He also became sensitized to the environment early on through working in his family small garden plots and farms and caring for the occasional family cow, horse or flock of chickens. By the later 1920s the family had moved to Los Angeles. Dick's father and uncle began building houses there during the housing boom, with Dick doing the architectural drafting and his younger brother the electrical work. The two young men helped their father and brother with everything from basic construction to fine cabinetry. After the building boom collapsed with the Depression, Dick opened a couple of sign shops and did sign painting and calligraphy. He took a few art classes at what was then Chouinard Art Institute, but never attended as a matriculated student. He continued to sketch and draw on his own.Dick's political thinking deepened with the Depression and seeing flocks of people uprooted by the Dust Bowl, hungry and homeless, stream into California. He began to see that art could be a vehicle to express ideas. Correll specialized in printmaking, primarily wood and linoleum block prints, but produced etchings and lithographs as well. In addition, he produced drawings, gouache paintings and two murals. Especially notable from Correll's WPA period is a suite of prints depicting the legendary American folk hero, Paul Bunyan. In one exhibition catalogue these were described to be "as large in spirit as their inspiration."During the Seattle years, Correll was a founding member of the Washington Artists' Union. He married his wife Alice in 1938. He had several solo shows and exhibited widely in national juried group shows (Print Club of Philadelphia, the California Etcher's Society, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's Print Annual.) In 1939 his work was exhibited at the New York Worlds Fair. Many of the works from the WPA period are today in the collections of museums, universities, and public buildings and continue to be shown and circulated. His murals of Paul Bunyan remain in a high school in Bremerton, Washington. Curator and fine print dealer M. Lee Stone writes, "In 1941 Correll and his wife moved to New York City where he remained for 11 years working in the commercial art field. New York's commercial and fine art scenes, however, were not without their difficulties. While commercial work paid decently, Correll always thought it a 'sorry thing' to use one's artistic abilities to sell products. His values were completely opposed to those of Madison Avenue, and this contradiction plagued him throughout his commercial career. As America entered World War II, Correll, at 36, was too old for the draft. He joined the Civilian Defense Corps as an Air Raid Warden in the Greenwich Village area. He also did artwork for Civil Defense, producing dozens of pro bono flyers, banners, signs and posters for various causes." Daughter Leslie was born in 1944.After joining the Artists League of America (ALA), an organization of progressive artists and sculptors "devoted to social, cultural, and economic interest of artists", Correll served as Publication Chair of the ALA News from 1943 on, and by 1946 was Editor. Membership in those years included Rockwell Kent, Lynd Ward, Jacob Lawrence and Moses Soyer. He exhibited regularly with ALA, and his linocut, "Air Raid Wardens" was included in the "Artists for Victory" travelling exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and 26 other venues in the USA and Canada.  New York was an especially exciting place for an artist during these years. Murals by the Mexican artists could be seen in the School for Social Research as well as in the Museum of Modern Art. Refugees from fascist persecution were bringing over the latest European art theories.  George Grosz was teaching at the Art Students League. Correll knew Fritz Eichenberg, Robert Gwathmey and Miguel Covarrubias among others.  Receiving serious attention in New York for the first time were works by Kathe Kollwitz, Edvard Munch, Miguel Covarrubias, Joseph Cornell, and the major collection of African sculpture owned by fellow ALA member Ladislas Segy.  Fellow artists Norman Barr, Harry Roth and Abe Blashko were good friends of the Corrells.  In 1952 Dick had had enough of Madison Avenue and the family moved back to the West Coast, this time to San Francisco.  Soon Dick joined the newly formed Graphic Arts Workshop and Printmakers Gallery of San Francisco, a dynamic group of progressive artist-activists who shared studio and exhibition space as well as the desire to serve the ideals of peace and social justice through their artwork. The GAW was then located in North Beach, which threw Dick into the vital art and cultural movement of the 1950s. Through his lifelong membership in the Workshop he and met and worked with many other noted San Francisco artists and muralists of his generation such as Emmy Lou Packard, Irving Fromer, Victor Arnautoff, William Wolff, Louise Gilbert, Pele de Lappe and Stanley Koppel. In 1954 he realized a lifelong dream of visiting México, the famous Taller de Gráfica Popular and the great works of Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros that had so influenced him and his generation.In 1969 Correll happily retired from the commercial art field and was able to work full time at his fine art. The family moved to Oakland, across the Bay from San Francisco in 1972, where Dick could at last have a garden and a large studio. Upon the occasion of his 80th birthday he was honored with a major retrospective exhibition and community celebration. He died in 1990 at the age of 85. A monograph on his work (Richard V. Correll: Prints and Drawings) was published in 2005, to recognize the centenary of his birth.  On two occasions Correll participated with other artists in an attempt to form a union: in Washington with the Washington Artists Union and in New York City with the Artists League of America. Colleagues in the latter included Rockwell Kent, Lynd Ward, Philip Evergood, Ladislas Segy, Harry Gottlieb, Robert Gwathmey, Moses Sawyer, Art Young and Harry Sternberg. Correll served as the organization's Publications Chair and Editor of the A.L.A. News.Correll's gentle and reserved demeanor was in sharp contrast to what San Francisco art critic Thomas Albright saw as the "remarkable boldness and strength" of his artwork. His themes often reflected his social conscience and he was attracted by heroic acts committed by everyday people in the struggle to achieve respect, freedom, and human rights. He marched with César Chávez and the United Farm Workers on their historic journey from Delano to Sacramento, contributed to and mounted the inaugural exhibition for the S.F. Afro-American Historical and Cultural Society, and created countless posters, leaflets, signs, and exhibits to civil rights, Native American, senior, labor, environmental, and world peace groups. -Text excerpted courtesy of Correll Studios, www.richardvcorrell.com.

=545  0\$aJohn S. Daschbach was a salesman, teacher, and civil rights worker from Seattle, Washington. He chaired the Washington Civil Rights Congress, the local branch of a national organization which was organized in 1946 for the "defense of the constitutional rights and civil liberties of the American people, including Communists and Negroes." The Civil Rights Congress took an interest in cases which involved Communists or Black Americans whom the National Congress supported with legal assistance, fund raising, and publicity. Accused of being a Communist front organization, the Civil Rights Congress was investigated by the Subversive Activities Control Board and a grand jury. Daschbach was one of seven defendants who were arrested in 1952 as accused Communists and tried in 1953 under the Smith Act in U.S. vs. Huff et. al. In 1956 the organization and its branches dissolved. Daschbach was also a board member, extension director, and teacher at the Seattle Labor School (also known as the Pacific Northwest Labor School). His wife, Marjorie Daschbach, was also a board member.
=520  2\$aThe papers document Daschbach's activities as chair of the Washington State Civil Rights Congress and as extension director and teacher at the Seattle Labor School. In addition to organizational records, the Civil Rights Congress (Washington State) series includes files concerning a number of civil rights cases in which the Civil Rights Congress took an interest, for example, the Foley Square Trial and the Seattle Smith Act case. Most cases involved Communists or African Americans whom the National Congress supported with legal assistance, fund raising, and publicity. The series also includes information about the Washington State House of Representatives' Committee on Un-American Activities, commonly known as the Canwell Committee. The Seattle Labor School series includes minutes, correspondence, teaching materials, newsletters, and ephemera from the school. The Personal Papers series includes collected documentation on the Boeing Strike in 1941.

=545  \\$aJohn Eyer was an organizer, international representative and training specialist based in Portland, Oregon, for the International Brotherhood of Pulp, Sulphite & Paper Mill workers, circa 1951-1964. As a training representative, beginning in 1956, he became a confidant of Research and Education head, George W. Brooks, who figured in the internal campaign for reform, and whose forced resignation precipitated the formation of the Rank and File Movement for Democratic Action (RFMDA). Eyer seems to have inherited Burt D. Wells' files on this heavily West Coast revolt. Following the establishment of the new union, the Association of Western Pulp and Papermakers in 1964, Eyer became an international representative, and chaired its Job Analysis Program. John Eyer died in 1986.
=520  2\$aCorrespondence, negotiation files, agreements, subject files, newsletters, court papers, and other material, relating to Eyer's activities as international representative of International Brotherhood of Pulp, Sulphite, and Paper Mill Workers, based in Portland, Or., organizer at mills in the Pacific Northwest during the 1950s, and his later work in the union's Research and Education Dept., where he was in charge on the West Coast. Papers also document the reform movement in the union, including the controversy over the forced resignation of George W. Brooks, head of Research and Education Dept., 1961, resulting in formation of Rank and File Movement for Democratic Action within the union, revolt of West Coast locals and formation of West Coast Pulp and Paper Workers, 1964, in which Eyer served as general vice-president from 1965-1968. Includes files of Burt D. Wells, secretary/treasurer of Rank and File Movement for Democratic Action, and other leaders. Major correspondent is John P. Burke.

=545  0\$aRosa Millo Eyer (1910-1991) was Recording Secretary of the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers (AWPPW) Local 644 in Everett, Washington in 1965 and AWPPW Secretary-Treasurer of the Northern Washington and Alaska Area Council during the 1960s and 1970s. She gave birth to three daughters: Gerry, Josephine, and Caroline with first husband Richard J. Millo. She later married Pacific Northwest paper worker representative John H. Eyer around the mid to late 1960s. Rosa retired from the union in 1972. She passed away in Everett, Washington at the age of 81 on November 10, 1991.
=520  2\$aThe papers of Rosa Millo Eyer consists of a small series of Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers (AWPPW) records and another of personal papers. The first series is primarily AWPPW Northern Washington-Alaska Area Council records of which Rosa was Secretary-Treasurer, including correspondence, news clippings, notes, and Executive Board reports from Area Representative John R. Swanson as well as a file of correspondence related to Rosa's employment with the union. The series of personal papers consists primarily of letters to and from Rosa and her daughters, Gerry, Josephine, and Caroline; divorce and death records and ephemera from her first marriage with Richard J. Millo; several photographs of family members; and other correspondence to and from Rosa. Due to the collection's distinctiveness as a body of records created or acquired during the course of Rosa M. Eyer's work and personal life and the importance of bringing out women's contributions to the labor movement whenever possible, this collection was separated from the John H. Eyer papers during processing in January 2017.

=545  0\$aJudge Michael James Fox was born in New London, Connecticut in 1944. During the 1960s, he became politically active in the Civil Rights Movement. While attending law school in Georgia, Fox was part of the Legal Aid Society--an organization that provided legal services to people from low-income backgrounds. After law school, his experience with the Legal Aid Society greatly influenced his decision to continue to help underrepresented people. Having also acquired Spanish speaking skills, Fox became interested in working with the large population of Spansih-speaking Latino/a farmworkers. In 1965, the US Congress created the Office of Economic Opportunity which funded the Legal Services Program, a private non-profit corporation providing legal services to people living in poverty. In that same year, a strike of Filipino American grape pickers in Delano, California gained the cooperation of Cesar Chavez and others, who began organizing migrant agricultural workers in California. Using the same organizing model, workers in Washington State  organized an independent branch of the United Farm Workers of Washington State in 1967. In 1969, Fox moved to Washington through the Reginald Heber Smith Fellowship, a program that places lawyers in areas to help those who do not have access to legal aid, and discovered that the state had the fourth largest migrant farmworker population in the country. In the following year, the wildcat hop strikes began in the Yakima Valley. Fox connected with the organizers of the hop strikes, Tomás Villanueva and Lupe Gamboa, and offered to provide legal representation to the emerging farmworkers union. As the UFW lawyer, Fox in Garza v. Patnode (1971) argued (1971) argued successfully that farmworkers had the right to organize. In that same year, Fox and Lupe Gamboa were arrested and convicted for trespassing onto the Roger's Walla Walla labor camp. Their convictions were eventually overturned and the decision confirmed that tenants in labor camps had the right to meet with union representatives and attorneys. Both cases were instrumental to the early efforts of the union (see State v. Fox, 1973 ). Fox continued to provide legal representation to the UFW until 1988. In that year Fox became a King County Superior Court Judge. On the bench, Fox called attention to the treatment of minorities in the legal system, particularly related to drug sentencing. Fox retired in 2011 after a distinguished judicial career.
=520  \\$aThis collection traces a series of legal cases arising out of the June 19, 1971 arrest for trespassing of Seattle-King County Legal Services attorney Michael Fox and union organizer Guadalupe Gamboa of the UFW Co-op in Toppenish. Fox and Gamboa visited the Rogers Walla Walla Inc. migrant labor camp following Gamboa's contact with workers there who had grievances regarding their working and living conditions.  When they attempted to meet with workers, Rogers employees refused them entry without their naming the individuals they were meeting with and the purpose of their meeting.  Fox and Gamboa refused to provide names, reasoning that employees named would be in potential danger of losing their jobs or worse.  Rogers representatives called the sheriff who arrested Fox and Gamboa for trespassing and fined them {dollar}25 each.  Fox and Gamboa appealed their conviction to the Superior Court of the County of Walla Walla, which affirmed the conviction in December 1971.  Fox and Gamboa then appealed to the Washington State Supreme Court, which reversed the finding of the Superior Court in May 1973.  This established an important precedent for future organizers and attorneys in the state.  The State of Washington sought a hearing in the United State Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case.  In Fox v. Klundt [Walla Walla County Sheriff] et al, Fox brought a civil suit against representatives of Rogers Walla Walla for damages and received a settlement of {dollar}6,000. Reinclude legal materials and  newspapers articles relating to the court cases. Other records relate to the State of Washington State v. Michael Fox, 1973.

=545  0\$aFor thirty years Jean Gundlach served as administrative assistant of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Coast Committee, working closely with ILWU President Harry Bridges. Gundlach was born in Missouri and moved to Seattle in the 1940s. In 1946 she began work as secretary of the Committee for Maritime Unity, and later worked for the United Fisherman and Allied Workers of America (UFAWA). When the UFAWA merged with the ILWU in the 1960s, Gundlach went to work for the ILWU and Harry Bridges. Throughout her life, Gundlach was devoted to progressive causes, working with migrant farm workers in the 1950s and even leading a walkout at the ILWU when Bridges and other officers treated staff unfairly. In the 1990s Gundlach was instrumental in obtaining a formal apology from the University of Washington to the victims of the Canwell Committee trials. In 1992 she had a major role in the creation of the Harry Bridges Chair in Labor Studies, and in 2008 was awarded the Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies Robert Duggan Distinguished Supporter of Labor Studies Award. Jean Gundlach passed away December 11, 2009.

=545  0\$aThe International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District Lodge No. 751 traces its origins to the founding of Local Lodge 751 of the International Association of Machinists at the Boeing Airplane Company in 1935. This local union organized Boeing on an industrial rather than craft basis. The first collective bargaining agreement with Boeing was signed July 1, 1936. A union shop was established with the second contract, in 1937. The union was re-organized as District Lodge No. 751 in 1941. It now consists of local lodges 751-A (assembly and production workers), 751-C (machinists), 751-E (electronics workers), 751-F (inspectors, clerks, others), Local 86 (workers in Spokane area), Local 1123 (workers in Wenatchee area and Grand Coulee Dam), and Local 1951 (Richland).
=520  2\$aUnion governance records include District Lodge 751 council minutes, membership records, and records of union officer elections. Collective bargaining records include negotiation records and contacts with the Boeing Company (1943-1999) as well as records relating to strikes such as video recordings. Records of the District Lodge's Labor History Committee include publications on union history, video interviews with union activists, and memorabilia. Press and publicity records include clipping documenting press coverage of the union and its activities as well as items relating to the IAMAW's activities in the community. Records include numerous artifacts, including badges and pins, stickers and patches, and apparel related to the union and allied organizations.

=545  1\$aA labor union lodge representing machinists and aerospace workers in Seattle, Washington. In 1891 the National Association of Machinists changed its name to the International Association of Machinists (IAM), at a conference in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Seattle's Hope Lodge 79 was formed in 1898. In 1935 the machinists started to organize with the airline industry and in 1936, the Boeing Company signed the industry's first labor agreement.  During World War II, President Roosevelt issued an executive order and appointed a President's committee on Fair Employment Practices, which allowed for integration of IAM. In 1964, IAM changed its name to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.

=545  1\$aThe International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers was founded in St. Louis, Missouri in 1890, when a group of electrical workers got together and chartered the National Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 5221 under the leadership of its first president, Henry Miller. Local 217 of Seattle, Washington was established in 1901 and ordered defunct in 1908. For six years, dissenting forces within the union caused a split, with each side electing its own officers. The AFL ultimately deemed the McNulty-Collins faction as the legitimate brotherhood. In 1914, the IBEW Local 46 was formed in Seattle with a membership of 250 men of various occupations: inside wiremen, marine wiremen, radio workers and telephone operators that worked in shipyards, industrial areas, uptown Seattle and its vicinity. Over the years the departments of the IBEW grew to include Sound and Communication, Residential, Marine, HVAC, Electronics, Motor Shop, Neon Sign and Maintenance. Current Local 46 jurisdiction includes King, Kitsap, Jefferson and Clallam Counties. Today, Local 46 is composed of over 4,500 members in a variety of craft units as well as over 1200 associate members.Local 46 jurisdiction includes King, Kitsap, Jefferson and Clallam Counties.

Originally titled the National Typographical Union, the organization became the ITU in 1869 after entering into an affiliation with Canadian printing trade unions. The ITU was at the forefront of progressive initiatives within the labor movement, lobbying for an eight hour work day and condemning Sunday work. In 1987, members of the ITU approved affiliation with the Communication Workers of America. After the merger was completed, the CWA created a new Printing, Publishing and Media Workers (PPMWS) Sector in recognition of the distinct nature of the work these union members perform.

=545  1\$aOrganized in 1933 by workers at the Tacoma Smelter of the American Smelting and Refining Company, Local 25 of the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers frequently adopted the militant stance of its parent union. The Tacoma Smelter, located on Commencement Bay in the company town of Ruston, Washington, had been in existence since 1889. It was founded by William R. Rust as the Tacoma Smelting and Refining Company, and began operating in 1890 to smelt and refine lead, By 1912, the facility had been converted to a copper smelter and refinery. The International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers (formerly the Western Federation of Miners) had been formed in 1916; in 1967, it merged with the United Steelworkers of America. Local 25 continued with the United Steelworkers of America following this merger.
=520  2\$aThe International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, Local 25 records consist primarily of Local 25's administrative records and include materials relating to grievances and negotiations, arbitration of several grievances, agreements with the Tacoma Smelter, and Local 25's newsletter, The Straight of It. Most of the material in the collection dates from before the merger of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers with the United Steelworkers of America. There is minimal documentation of a strike in 1946 and a lockout in 1950, and a more significant amount of material relating to a lockout and extended work stoppage in 1959. Major correspondents include John Caughlan (Local 25's attorney) and several executive officers, including: John Clarke, Irving Dichter, William E. Lee, Elmer Olson, and Al Skinner.

From 1940 Local 101 represented workers in the Everett Weyerhaeuser mills and Eclipse Lumber Company. Unions which merged with Local 101 were other members active in the Snohomish Industrial Union Council (SIUC), local coordinating arm of the CIO. Local 18 of Cannery Workers' branch of the International Fishermen and Allied Workers of America, was also a member of the SIUC. Other local unions that merged with it included branches from Anacortes, Bellingham, Sedro Woolley, and Sultan, Washington. When Districts 2 and 3 of the union merged in 1953, the Everett local's designation changed from 2-101 to 23-101; in 1959 it became Local 3-101.

There is a large amount of news articles, research materials, and legislation related to labor issues spearheaded by Johnson including workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, minimum wage, worker privacy, job training, child labor, healthcare, farmworker issues, and "green" jobs. There are also files relating to coalitions with other organizations, including CASA Latina and Puget Sound Advocates for Retirement Action (PSARA), as well as lobbying groups and Political Action Committees (PAC's) that the WSLC was involved in.

=545  0\$aJeffrey George Johnson was born in Long Island, New York, in 1951. Jeff Johnson earned his B.A. in political science from Georgetown University and his M.A. and A.B.D. in political economy from the New School for Social Research. At Georgetown University he became involved in Civil Rights and anti-Vietnam War movements. Johnson began his union career in New York, N.Y. as a member of Local 2190 of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) in 1979. He worked as a teacher of labor economics and labor studies for members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 3. Johnson also taught classes for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU), Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU). Johnson taught classes for the National Congress of Neighborhood Women and worked as faculty at the Harry Van Arsdale Center for Labor Studies at State University of New York (SUNY) and the The National Labor College. In 1986, Johnson drove across the country with his wife and began working for the Washington State Labor Council (WSLC) as the Research Director. He also served as the shop steward for the WSLC's unionized employees in the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU), Local 8 from 1988-1993. Early in his career, Johnson was introduced to Tomas Villanueva, the president of the newly formed United Farm Workers (UFW) in Washington. At the time, farmworkers were not protected by minimum wage, pesticide control, or child labor laws, and they were ineligible for unemployment insurance or workers' compensation. Johnson and Villanueva worked together over a five year period to establish child labor and health and safety protections specifically for farmworkers, and they also ran minimum wage and workers' compensation initiatives. In addition, they launched a lawsuit to include farmworkers in unemployment insurance programs. In 1992, Johnson and Villanueva worked with Chicano activist and lawyer Guadalupe Gamboa and his uncle, a professor at the University of Washington, to write a collective bargaining bill for farmworkers in Washington, modeled after the California Labor Relations Act. In 1993, Johnson became the WSLC's Lead Lobbyist following changes in WSLC leadership due to the election of Mike Lowry as Washington governor. In 1998, he spearheaded another minimum wage initiative, creating a broad coalition of community organizations to back the campaign. Johnson was also involved in the WSLC's work around immigration reform and efforts to connect with the Latino community, including by affiliating with CASA Latina. Johnson assumed the role of Special Assistant to the President in 2008, while remaining the lead lobbyist. In 2010, Johnson was elected president of the WSLC and served two terms before retiring in 2018. During his time as president, Johnson was involved in much of the community outreach and coalition building from before. The WSLC, under his leadership, supported the first campaigns to raise the minimum wage to {dollar}15 per hour, first in SeaTac then in Seattle. He also promoted efforts to address issues of racism in labor and worked with state legislators on climate justice initiatives. Johnson is still active in Puget Sound Advocates for Retirement Action (PSARA), the Board of Labor Network for Sustainability, and other local causes.

=545  0\$aShaun Maloney was born in Minneapolis in 1911. As a youth, he adopted his stepfather's surname and was known as John (Jack) Severson, reverting to Maloney in about 1936. Influenced by the labor activism and radical politics of his mother and stepfather, Maloney joined the International Workers of the World and was an active Teamsters organizer throughout the Midwest during the 1930s. He became well known for his role on the negotiating committee during the bloody 1934 Teamsters strike in Minneapolis, and he served two years in a Minnesota penitentiary for a charge stemming from later organizing activities. Following his release in 1942, Maloney joined the Merchant Marine. After surviving an attack on his convoy enroute to Russia, he came to San Francisco and then Seattle, from where he worked as a seaman and took an active part in the Sailors' Union of the Pacific (SUP). When he supported union member John Mahoney, who had been expelled from the SUP for questioning the leadership's attempt to break a strike, however, Maloney was also expelled from the SUP. In 1953 Maloney joined the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (ILUW) and became active in Seattle's Local 19. During the 1960s and early '70s, Maloney was involved in several disputes and strikes that resulted from the controversial "Mechanization and Modernization" agreement of 1960, and from 1971-1976, he served five terms as the president of Local 19. Maloney retired in 1976 but remained an active figure in organized labor activities both locally and nationally. He died in Seattle in 1999.
=520  2\$aBiographical material, correspondence, minutes, speeches and writings, financial records, ephemera, assorted publications, photographs, tape recorded interviews and other recorded material on 268 audiocassettes and 1 reel-to-reel tape, interview transcripts, 10 VHS videocassettes, clippings, and numerous other materials documenting Maloney's involvement in the West Coast maritime and longshore unions, as well as the broader labor movement, his World War II service in the Merchant Marine, his political philosophy, and his personal life. Organizations described in the papers include the Teamsters, Sailors' Union of the Pacific, the ILWU, and ILUW Local 19. Major correspondents include Farrell Dobbs, Frank Lovell, Asher Harer, fellow Teamsters organizers Lou Miller and Jack Wirth, Minnesota labor activist Dave Riehle, and John Mahoney.

=545  1\$aThe Maritime Federation of the Pacific Coast. more commonly known as the Maritime Federation of the Pacific was an organization representing the interests of longshoremen, seamen, ship cooks and stewards, other various maritime occupations, agricultural and cannery workers in California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. Following the historic 1934 Pacific Maritime and San Francisco General Strike, labor unions and individuals representing different seafaring and shipping occupations overcame their divisions to form a more cohesive organization. It was established in 1935 when waterfront workers and seamen joined together to further the interests of unionism for all maritime workers on the West Coast.

=545  0\$aOttilie Lou (Kepner) Markholt was a white, female labor unionist, labor historian, and author who spent most of her life in Tacoma, Washington. She was born on February 25, 1916 to parents Alfred Silverthorne Kepner and Clara Reissennweber Kepner in Candle, Alaska. Her family moved first to Chicago in 1919 and then to West Seattle in 1921 where Ottilie spent the remainder of her childhood and adolescence. She attended West Seattle High School, working on the school newspaper, and graduated in 1933 as class Valedictorian.  After high school, Ottilie attended the University of Washington from 1933-1935. It was in college that she became active in leftist political organizing, joining the University Unit of the Young Communist League in 1935. Ottilie did not graduate college, leaving, according to the Preface of her book Maritime Solidarity, "to become a full-time revolutionary." It was through the Young Communist League that she met her first husband, Bob (Robert) Dombroff. They married on December 7, 1935. Bob was also active in leftist organizing and the labor movement when they met. They were both members of the Communist Party but dropped out in 1936.   Bob Dombroff was a sailor and an active member of the Sailors' Union of the Pacific as well as the Maritime Federation of the Pacific Coast (MFPC), a short-lived organization founded in 1935 to build solidarity amongst the different labor unions representing maritime workers. During this time, Ottilie helped form the Seattle Women's Maritime Auxiliary of the MFPC, compiled the Union Labels for Union Men booklet in 1937, and helped recruit author and activist Ralph Chaplin, Jr. to work as Editor of the MFPC's newspaper, the Voice of the Federation. Both Ottilie and Bob were openly critical of International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) President, Harry Bridges.    Bob and Ottilie had two sons, Bob and Lee. Bob was born in 1937 and Lee in 1939. After Bob Dombroff and Ottilie divorced in 1941, she relocated to Tacoma with her sons and temporarily worked a unionized waitressing job. She began working for the Tacoma Metal Trades Council in 1943 where she joined the Office Employees International Union Local 20360 which later became the Office and Professional Employees International Union Local 23. Ottilie worked for OPEIU Local 23 as Office Secretary beginning in 1949 until her retirement in 1981. She was also actively involved in the union itself, including attending the 1962 international convention as delegate and serving as Secretary-Treasurer in the 1960s.  Ottilie met her second husband, Halvor Markholt through Local 23. He worked as a timekeeper at the shipyards. They married in 1943, and Ottilie as well as her sons assumed the last name of Markholt. The family moved to a farm south of Tacoma in 1945. Ottilie and Halvor divorced in 1953.   Ottilie's Research & Writing   Ottilie spent many years researching and writing scholarly articles and manuscripts on a variety of topics, primarily related to the labor movement. Her published book Maritime Solidarity: Pacific Coast Unionism 1929-1938 emerged from expanded research beginning with her work on the Sailors' Union of the Pacific manuscript, completed in 1942 and originally credited solely to co-author Peter B. Gill. Ottilie conducted extensive research and worked on multiple drafts of Maritime Solidarity for many decades, including versions detailing earlier time periods. Ralph Chaplin, Jr. was an influence in encouraging her to resume research and writing in the 1950s, and labor historian Archie Green encouraged her to publish it in the early 1990s. After rejection from a number of publishers, the Pacific Coast Maritime History Committee was formed, initially as a part of the Pierce County Central Labor Council and composed of members of the labor community, to coordinate the publishing. Through community donations, including contributions from laborunions, enough money was raised to publish the book in 1998.   In addition to she researched and wrote several other manuscripts, including The Concern of All: Tacoma Working People and Their Unions, 1883-1895, sponsored by the Pierce County Central Labor Council in the 1980s; a biography of her parents called Alaska Homestead, completed in 1947; Nome, Alaska's Early Union Movement on early union organizing in Nome; and her autobiography, Against the Current, completed around 2001. She also assisted others in their research, including Ronald (Ron) Magden and A.D. Martinson for their 1982 publication, The working waterfront: the story of Tacoma's ships and men as well as Captain Harold Huycke in the early 2000s in writing a history of ILWU Local 90 in San Francisco, California.    Additionally, Ottilie wrote for a variety of local publications during her lifetime, including the Tacoma Labor Advocate when Ralph Chaplin was Editor in the 1940s. She was also Editor of the Tacoma NAACP newsletter in the early 1960s and the Pierce County Central Labor Council Education Committee's newsletter, The Labor Educator, which ran from 1985 to 1997.   Activism and Organizational Involvement    Ottilie was active in labor, civil rights, and social justice organizing, participating in a variety of organizations throughout her lifetime. In addition to her involvement in the Communist Party and OPEIU Local 23, she organized against "Right to Work" Initiatives 198 and 202 in Washington State during the 1950s. In 1964, Ottilie traveled to Buffalo, New York for research where she ended up volunteering in the office of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). She later joined the Tacoma-Olympia Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1971 and served as Branch Secretary for a number of years.   She was also actively involved in promoting and educating the community on the importance of labor history, including serving as the first Chair of the Pierce County Central Labor Council's Education Committee and coordinating research and writing for a pictorial history exhibit and the publication of To Live in Dignity as a part of the Washington State centennial celebrations in 1989. Along with her son Bob who was teaching labor studies courses at the Tacoma Community College, Ottilie made efforts to integrate labor history education into community college curriculum in the 1970s and 80s. She was also a founding member of the Pacific Northwest Labor History Association (PNLHA), joining in 1979 and serving as Vice President for several years in the 1990s as well as attending and presenting papers at the organization's annual meeting.   End of Life  Ottilie passed away on November 25, 2004 in Tacoma, Washington. A memorial was held on January 30, 2005 at the Local 23 hall of the ILWU in Fife, Washington.   Resources Consulted:  In addition to information derived from the collection itself, including a timeline of Markholt's life and a memorial program located in SERIES 5, Subseries A: Family Papers, resources consulted include the Preface of her book Maritime Solidarity: Pacific Coast Unionism, her autobiography Against the Current, and an obituary published in the Seattle Times in 2004.

=545  0\$aMatthew Meehan (1896-1977) was born in Rhode Island, working in textile factories before going to work as a sailor at the age of 14. Meehan worked as a merchant seaman until 1928, when he came ashore in Portland, Oregon to become a longshore worker. Meehan was the head of the International Longshoremen's Association, Local 38-78 (Portland; later International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 8), before and after the 1934 Pacific Coast Maritime Strike. In 1936, Meehan became the editor of the ILA Pacific Coast's newspaper, The Pacific Coast Longshoreman. In 1937, Meehan was elected the first Secretary-Treasurer of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, the international union that formed when the Pacific Coast District of the ILA split from the rest of the ILA and joined the Congress of Industrial Organizations. In 1944, Meehan went to the Hawai'ian Islands to scout its prospects of potential organizing by the ILWU, laying the groundwork for what would become a transformational union drive and ILWU Local 142. In 1957, Meehan was appointed an arbitrator between the ILWU and its employer association, the Pacific Maritime Association. Meehan died at the age of 80 near Mount Hood, Oregon.

=545  0\$aJohn (Jack) Leonard Miller was born on November 3, 1889 in Dayton, Kentucky. At 12 he left home and traveled around the country hoboing and taking odd jobs. He worked as a coal miner in Danville, Virginia and a harvester in the Midwest. Because of his interest in worker's rights, Miller joined the United Mine Workers while in Virginia. He joined the Socialist Party while he was in Canada and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1916. He moved to Seattle in early 1916 and was on board the Verona during the Everett Massacre of November 1916. He married Violet Wilson in 1924. After settling down Miller had a number of jobs and began writing. He continued to rally for workers rights and upon his retirement took up lobbying for fair treatment of senior citizens. In addition, he gave lectures and interviews regarding the Everett Massacre, and wrote short stories. He died at age 96 in 1986 of a heart ailment. He was the last living survivor of the Everett Massacre.

He participated in the 1934 Pacific Coast Maritime Strike at the "Battle at Smith Cove" that almost completely shut down merchant access in the area. He was known for blocking train access on the Seattle Waterfront during the event and was nicknamed the "Train Stopper" as a result. The strike was in response to the port leadership's failure to comply with the National Industrial Recovery Act and the protection of collective bargaining rights for unions. Moisio was also a member of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Pacific Coast Pensioner's association and attended many conventions and gatherings hosted by the association.

=545  1\$aThe Musicians' Association of Seattle, American Federation of Musicians Local 76-493 is a labor union that represents musicians in Seattle; Vashon Island; Clallam, Grays Harbor, Jefferson, King, Kitsap, Kittitas, Mason, Island, Pierce, San Juan, Skagit, Thurston, and Whatcom counties; and parts of Pacific County. Local 76-493 has been a labor organization since 1890 and is led by elected officers and an elected board of directors. Musicians' unions began in Seattle in 1890 with the creation of the Seattle chapter of the Musicians Mutual Protective Union (MMPU) Local 76. MMPU Local 76 reorganized under the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) Local 76 in 1898 and represented white musicians. Non-white musicians were barred from joining AFM Local 76 so they formed a separate union, AFM Local 458. Tension between the two unions resulted in the international union revoking Local 458's charter in April of 1924. However, Black and other musicians of color were able to charter a replacement union, Local 493, later that year. In 1958, Local 76 and Local 493 were amalgamated into Local 76, ending the racial segregation of musicians' unions in Seattle. In 1994 the local's name was changed to Local 76-493. Previously distinct AFM locals in Western Washington became amalgamated under the jurisdiction of Local 76-493 between 1980 and 2010 including AFM Local 117, Tacoma; AFM Local 184, Everett; AFM Local 124, Olympia; AFM Local 236, Aberdeen; AFM Local 451, Bellingham; and AFM Local 461, Mount Baker/Anacortes.

=545  1\$aFormed in 1901 as Marine Cooks and Stewards Association of the Pacific Coast. In 1934, under the name Marine Cooks and Stewards Union, they secured recognition as important union. It represented the service workers in the steward departments of United States vessels that sailed in the Pacific. In 1950, under the name National Union of Marine Cooks and Stewards, the union was expelled from the CIO as a Communist dominated union when members refused the anti-communist pledge. It then became the focus of a power struggle between the Seafarers International Union and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. Although the NUMCS were leaning toward the ILWU, the sailor's union (SUP), managed to orchestrate an election that brought in other predominately white unions, who tipped the vote in favor of affiliation with the AFL.

=545  0\$aLonnie Nelson was born in Seattle Aug. 20, 1932, and named Madelon Sue by her parents Alma Viola Nickerson Nelson and Burt Gale Nelson. Her father was a founding member of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and a leader of the Communist Party of Washington State. In high school in 1948 she organized Young Progressives and was active in the Progressive Party campaign of Henry Wallace. She joined the Communist Party in 1951 at a time when CP members, including her father, were being blacklisted and harassed by the FBI. She gathered signatures on the Stockholm Peace Appeal in the 1950s when Cold War elements were itching for war against the Soviet Union or China. That commitment to world peace continued in the years of solidarity with Cuba and Vietnam when she helped mobilize peace protests. She was especially proud of a trip she took to Spain where veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, including her uncle, were honored as fighters against Franco fascism. Nelson served as chairperson of a petition campaign against the McCarthy-era loyalty oath, which in 1972 presented 10,000 signatures to the state attorney general in Olympia. Later, she served on a committee defending the Black Panther Party. An admirer of the Native American Indian people, she joined in the campaign to win restoration of the tribes' fishing rights. She befriended many of the Native American Indians in that struggle, working closely with Maiselle Bridges, a leader of the Nisqually tribe. Victory was won when Judge George Boldt handed down his landmark ruling 40 years ago that the tribes were entitled to half the salmon catch. Her love of the Indian peoples and their struggles led her to join the "Trail of Broken Treaties" to Washington, D.C., in 1972, when the American Indian Movement occupied the Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters. She helped raise funds for the legal defense of the occupiers. She knew Hank Adams and other Native American Indian leaders personally and interviewed them for articles in the Daily World during that sit-in. Lonnie Nelson's first love was always the labor movement. During her working years, she was employed at a day care center at Providence Hospital for nearly six years. She worked to organize the workers into SEIU Local 6. She helped establish the Seattle branch of the Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW), heading up the CLUW Public Works Jobs Committee. She was arrested three times for civil disobedience: during the Indian fishing rights struggle, against South African apartheid, and in the mid-1990s against Republican Newt Gingrich's "Contract on America" Medicare cuts.

=520  2\$aCollection of longshore maritime history materials gathered by Norman Parks relating to International Longshore and Warehouse Local 8 (Portland) and its predecessor, International Longshoremen's Association, Local 38-78. Much of the collection relates to the history of the Pacific Coast ILA and ILWU, with an emphasis on Portland and the 1934 Pacific Coast Maritime Strike. Included are medals minted by the Citizen's Emergency League, based out of Portland, Oregon. The League was a vigilante group started by the Portland Chamber of Commerce to break through picket lines caused by the 1934 maritime strike. According to historian Michael Munk, "CEL members wore the service disks, inscribed 'CEL- for Law and Order' on one side and 'Minute Men, Lexington, Mass., 1776- Portland, Ore., 1934' on the other....they were stamped with the member's number and - together with red, white, and blue armbands bearing the letters C-E-L - were 'to be worn by members in case of being called out as law enforcement officers.'" The context of the CEL is that many Portland police officers had relatives that were longshoremen and who were a They thought police were coddling longshoremen and passing on intelligence. The employers hired WWI veterans to beat up longshoremen during the strike, housing them on terminal 4. Oral tradition claims that longshoremen would beat the strikebreakers in retaliation for their attacks on strikes and take their coins as mementoes. Other coins in the collection include tokens good for a free meal or trade for strikers at various Portland waterfront bars, restaurants, and businesses including Ericson's Bar, Longshoreman's Social Club, the Portland Seamen's Center, and the Longshoremen's Lunch and Card Room. Other materials relate to the history of the strike, and an article by on the history and provenance of the vigilante coins and lunch tokens. The collection also includes a roster of post- WWII members kept to document who was registered and entitled to pension.

The old hall was at 17th and Glissan and was previously a Swedish Church. During the move union member found a hidden room while rewiring, including materials relating to Local 8 and its history. Parks rescued the materials, which were in the process of being thrown away. Significant materials include a telegram from the 1934 Pacific Coast Maritime Strike and a minute books from Peabody, an early secretary of ILA in 1888 in Portland.

From 1977 to 1978, Parry and Ross Rieder, of the Washington State Labor Council, organized King County unions to assist workers in picketing automobile dealerships. The strikes were in reaction to a growing trend among the dealerships to open their shops to non-union work. Parry and Ross paired again to organize the Washington State delegation of union members and supporters for Solidarity Day -- a rally against the Reagan administration initiated by the AFL-CIO Executive Council and held in Washington, D.C., on September 19, 1981.

=545  1\$aThe Tacoma Trades Council was organized in 1890 as an independent organization. It was dormant March, 1895 until November, 1899 when it affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. After it was dissolved in September, 1907, a new body, the Tacoma Central Labor Council, was chartered by the AFL in November, 1907. The records of the Tacoma Trades Council were turned over to the Central Labor council at this time. As a result of the AFL-CIO merger the Tacoma Central Labor Council (AFL) and the Pierce County Industrial Union Council (CIO) merged to form the Pierce County Central Labor Council in December, 1957. In 1909 the Central Labor Council established its newspaper, the "Tacoma Labor Advocate," which was published until 1978.

=545  1\$aThe history of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers or IFPTE, can be traced back to 1914, when technical employees had no significant union representation. The first organization of technical employees was the Society of Marine Draftsmen, established in 1913 and ran by the upper management of the shipbuilding companies. The Society held its first convention in 1914, approving some minor resolutions while refusing wage increases. The Society disbanded shortly after, but the employees at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Virginia seized the opportunity to form their own union, Draftsmen Union No, 15327, with a charter from the American Federation of Labor (AFL). These organized employees later became IFPTE, Local 1, becoming one of the first official federal unions. In less than four years, Draftsmen Union No, 15327, expanded to become the International Federation of Draftsmen's Unions founded on July 1, 1918 when the AFL granted another charter to start a new labor organization representing technical engineering employees. The International Federation of Draftsmen's Unions charters included Local 1, Portsmouth, Virginia; Local 2, New York, New York; Local 3, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Local 4, Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Local 5, Newport, Rhode Island; Local 6, Charleston, South Carolina; Local 7, Quincy, Massachusetts; Local 8, Vallejo, California; and Local 12, Bremerton, Washington. For full historical note, see online finding aid.
=520  2\$aThese records are arranged into eleven series: compensation and class specifications, meeting notes, financial records, Puget Sound Power and Light Company, letters, agreements, organizing services, San Francisco chapter, union-related publications, 2000 convention, and union paraphernalia. Compensation and class specifications provide insight into the duties, titles, salary, and benefits of technical workers from 1928 to 1964. Financial records were arranged by year. Puget Sound Power and Light Company includes organization charts, National Labor Relations Board petition and briefs, and information on strike issues. Letters were arranged by topic and date. Agreements include multiple contracts concerning trade workers: Coulee Dam engineers, Pacific Coast Shipbuilders, public utilities workers, log scalers, technical engineers, architects, and the Seattle Metal Trades Council. Organizing services is divided between Boeing-related literature and general organizing letters and reports. Union-related publications include membership materials, copies of biographical drafts, and IFPTE's West Coast Engineer Newsletters arranged by date, from 1981-1996. Union paraphernalia contains a labor songbook and photo negatives on wooden printing blocks.

Ranta and his brother emigrated from Finland to join their father in Alaska working summers for the Alaska Packers' Association and Libby, McNeill and Libby. Both companies manufactured and packaged canned salmon. Ranta worked as a fisherman during the early days of commercial salmon fishing in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Washington, Canada, and Alaska. He also worked during the transition from the industry being fleets of smaller sailing ships to larger ships with internal combustion engines. Ranta left the fishing industry during this transition and his family started a plywood mill in Port Angeles, Washington to replace fishing as their main economic activity.
=520  2\$aMaterials include photographs and fishing "tally books" that document Toivo Ranta's career as a commercial fisherman in Alaska primarily from 1930 to 1960.

=545  0\$aRichard "Rick" Rice was born in 1940 and grew up in Huntington Beach, California. Rice attended the University of California at Berkeley before moving to New York City and then to Seattle in the early 1970s. Rice was active in the student, anti-war, and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Rice worked as a bus driver for Metro Transit for four years, where he was an active union member and a member of a rank-and-file caucus committe. Rice participated in a Metro Transit strike in 1974. During the 70s and 80s, Rice was an activist in several local organizations such as Committee for Solidarity with the People of El Salvador (CISPES), the Venceremos Brigade, and the Anti-apartheid movement. Rice participated in weekly protests in front of the South African consulate in Seattle during this period. His wife, Roselynn Harrell (also known as Rose Woodward) was also a Seattle metro driver and a social and labor activist. Harrell was involved in South Seattle Community College's Women's Employment Network and was a welder. Rice and Harrell worked for two years at a Uniroyal and Firestone tire plant in Long Beach California in an effort to organize it politically as an outgrowth of their activism as members of the socialist organization Line of March. Line of March was a Marxist-Leninist organization that inspired many New Left student activists to become "proletarianized" workers who would find work in industry and radicalize other workers. During the 1990s, Rice was active in the Seattle area efforts to create a Labor Party and attended conferences on behalf of the effort. Rice's second wife, Kate Thompson is an artist and an activist and many of the prints in this collection are hers. Thompson was a cofounder and coowner of Storefront Press in Seattle. As of 2014, Rice lives in Mexico.
=520  2\$aMaterials relating to Rick Rice's activism and career in various industries. Formats include posters, flyers, photographs, pamphlets, booklets, and ephemera that document his activism and worklife. Rice was active in the student, anti-war, and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Materials include records from his participation as a striking bus driver in the Seattle Metro Transit Strike of 1974. The collection includes materials from Rice's activism from the 1960s-1990s, including organizations such as the Committee for Solidarity with the People of El Salvador (CISPES), the Venceremos Brigade (a Cuban solidarity organization), the Anti-Apartheid movement, Teamsters for a Democratic Union, various labor rank-and-file committees, and a variety of socialist organizations. Materials also reflect Rice's involvement with Jobs with Justice. Other materials relate to solidarity work for the 1989 Puget Sound Grocery Workers Strike. Solidarity with Nicaragua, Canto, and Line of March. His wife, Roselynn Harrell (also known as Rose Woodward) was also a Seattle metro driver and a social and labor activist.

The successor organization, SEIU Local 925, is comprised of the public sector employees of the former locals. Minutes of the Bellingham Central Labor Council are part of the collection, apparently because it was within BSEIU Local 108's geographic and occupational jurisdiction of Bellingham Washington before they merged with Local 120.

=545  1\$aShip Scalers Union, Local 541 represented ship scalers working in the Seattle area from the 1930s until 1986. Ship scalers clean the interior and exterior of ships, scraping and sandblasting, mopping up fuel from tanks, and removing debris. The work is considered some of the most unpleasant, dangerous, and poorly paid in the shipbuilding industry. After World War II a majority of the members of the local were African Americans. The local had a series of conflicts with the international to which it belonged, centering around efforts by the local rank and file to elect a slate of reform candidates as officers in 1972 and again in 1980. The dispute led to years of court challenges and reversals. Local 541 was suspended by the Laborers' International Union of North America in 1986 and representation of Seattle area ship scalers was subsequently transferred to another local. Until 1956 the union was affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers (AFL) as Local 589, then changed to the International Hod Carriers', Building and Common Laborers' Union of America (AFL) as Local 541. In 1965 the Boilermakers changed their name to Laborers' International Union of North America.
=520  2\$aRecords of union local, including meeting minutes, correspondence, grievances, by-laws, membership records, and records of arbitration and litigation. There are also case files of members and campaign materials. The litigation particularly involves the dispute with the international, to which the local belonged, regarding the election of officers to the local.

=545  0\$aEmil Frank Skowronek (aka Clark) (1904-1993) was born in Poland and immigrated to the United States as a young child. Skowronek graduated high school in Tacoma. As a young man, Skowronek worked as a logger on the Olympic Peninsula for five years to fund his education at Washington State University, where he was a member of the wrestling team. While he worked as a logger, he was radicalized by the Industrial Workers of the World. He was a member of the Communist Party USA and served as a left wing labor organizer. Skowronek later became a ship rigger in the boilermaker's union and served as a business agent in the union. During World War II, Skowronek served in the merchant marine, where he was involved in the Battle of Okinawa. He lost his seamen's clearance for his political affiliations but was able to regain it. Skowronek married Edna Theodosia Bundry in 1935. Edna Theodosia Skowronek (1903-1976) graduated in 1932 with a Bachelor of Science in nursing from the University of Washington. She worked as a registered nurse. Emil and Edna's daughter Theodosia Skowronek "Theo" Nassar (1939- ) received her BA in Sociology from Washington State University and her MS in Teaching/Communications from Gonzaga University. She worked as a caseworker at Eastern State Mental Hospital and as a copywriter and journalist in Spokane before moving to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter for ten years. Emil and Edna's son Felix Skowronek (1935-2006) played principal flute for the Seattle Symphony from 1956 to 1957 and 1959 to 1960. Skowroneck also played in the Seventh Army Symphony from 1957 to 1959, Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra 1960 to 1966, and St. Louis Symphony 1966 to 1968, and was a member of the Casals Festival orchestra in Puerto Rico and a founding member of the Soni Ventorum Wind Quintet. He was a member of the faculty of the Conservatory of Music of Puerto Rico, and then at the University of Washington, where he taught for 38 years, and served as president of the National Flute Association and Seattle Flute Society. He was a leading figure in the revival of wooden Boehm-style flutes in the USA and an expert in the use of various hardwoods in flute manufacturing.

=545  1\$aThe Seattle Section of the Socialist Labor Party (SLP) was founded in the early 1890s as a branch of the Socialist Labor Party of America, the first nationwide socialist party in the United States. The Seattle Section was one of the first socialist organizations of any importance in the Pacific Northwest, but because it did not effectively establish ties with the labor movement, it never developed beyond a small cadre. During the period documented by these papers (1930-1962), the Section frequently consisted of fewer than six active members, and, at times (particularly in the early 1950s), nearly ceased to exist. Section Seattle experienced frequent internal dissent, occasionally expelled members, and, in 1944, itself was censured, expelled from the Party and reorganized. The business of the Section was carried on by an organizer who was chosen democratically and who reported to the Secretary of the State Executive Committee (SEC). SEC answered to the National Executive Committee, which was headed by the National Secretary (an office held by Arnold Peterson throughout this period). The official organ of the Party was the Weekly People, which the Section sold through subscriptions and newsstands. Its other activities included the sale of SLP pamphlets, distribution of leaflets, conducting classes, lectures and social activities. The SLP in Washington held an annual convention and also ran conventions to nominate candidates for state elections.
=520  2\$aThe Socialist Labor Party Seattle Section records consist mainly of correspondence, ephemera, financial records, minutes and convention proceedings relating to the Seattle branch of a national political party.$bThe collection also includes some records of the Washington State Executive Committee (SEC; 1944-1962) and the Spokane Section (1943-1944). The records of the SEC Secretary consist primarily of SEC Minutes and the 1949 correspondence of Theodore Bossie, who was then SEC Secretary (but also a longtime member and former organizer of Section Seattle). Major correspondents other than Bossie, include Arnold Peterson (National Secretary) and Herb Steiner (Regional representative, circa 1944).

=545  0\$aVernon R. Stedman (1916-1993) was a National Labor Bureau researcher and labor negotiator for maritime unions who was based in Seattle, Washington.$bDuring the 1950s, he studied economics at the University of Washington and conducted research for a dissertation tentatively entitled "Development of Collective Bargaining in the Puget Sound Inland Waterways Industry." The project dealt largely with the history of the Inlandboatmen's Union of the Pacific (IBU), but also to some extent, the Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association and the Masters, Mates and Pilots. In his research Stedman consulted with individuals associated with these unions, including John M. Fox and Clyde W. Deal. Stedman did not complete his dissertation.
=520  2\$aVernon Stedman's papers consist primarily of drafts of dissertation chapters in varying stages of completion, as well as materials which Stedman collected, presumably for use in writing his dissertation.$bAlso present are Stedman's coursework, and several subject files covering topics which Stedman documented primarily through newspaper clippings. Of special note is a transcript of an interview Stedman conducted with Clyde W. Deal in 1955. Major correspondents include Clyde W. Deal, John M. Fox and economist Robert J. Lampman.

=545  0\$aSocial worker and welfare policy analyst Kay Thode worked as Director of the Seattle Urban League's Health and Welfare Department from 1968 to 1983. She subsequently worked as a planner for the King County Health Planning Council, a subarea council of the Puget Sound Health Systems Agency. Throughout her career she was tireless in advocating and lobbying for the rights of welfare recipients and the poor, and testified frequently before local, state, and federal government bodies. She was active in the Puget Sound Chapter of the National Association of Social Workers, serving as Newsletter Editor, President, and delegate to NASW's national assembly several times. At the organization's national level she was chair of the National Committee on Women's Issues and was a member of the National Social Policy and Action Cabinet. She was named Social Worker of the Year by the Puget Sound Council in 1972, and by the Washington State Chapter in 1979. She was also active in the Washington Association for Social Welfare, presenting a paper at its conference on The Worth of Work in, 1977, and serving as keynote speaker at its 1978 legislative conference. She was elected President of the organization in October 1979. She initiated the group Washington State Friends of Welfare Rights to support the activities of the Washington State and National Welfare Rights Organizations, and served on the boards of the Washington Coalition for a National Health Program, the Council of Planning Affiliates Legislative Comittee, Neighborhood Health Centers, the Fair Budget Action Campagn, the Welfare Rights Organizing Committee, and People for Fair Taxes. She also served on advisory committees for entities including King County Hospital, the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, and Seattle City Light. Thode's husband Bob Thode appeared before the anti-Left Canwell Committee during the Red Scare of the 1950s--partly because of her activism.

=545  0\$aJerry Tyler became active in organized labor in the 1940s, and remained active throughout his career as a longshoreman. This activism led to his work as a radio broadcaster in 1948 when the Seattle CIO Industrial Union Council, for which Tyler was secretary, decided to start a radio program. Tyler also authored a number of books, focusing primarily on "pulp fiction" in the 1930s and on non-fiction later in his life.

=545  1\$aUNITE HERE is an international labor union in the United States and Canada with roughly 300,000 active members. The union represents workers in the hotel, food service, laundry, warehouse, and casino gaming industries. The union was formed by a 2004 merger of two international unions: the Union of Needletrades, Industrial, and Textile Employees (UNITE) and Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE). In 2005, UNITE HERE withdrew from the AFL-CIO and joined the Change to Win Federation, along with several other unions, including the Teamsters, Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the UFCW. In May 2009, union president Bruce Raynor (originally from UNITE) left UNITE HERE, taking with him numerous local unions and between 105,000 and 150,000 members, mostly garment workers and a labor-owned bank, Amalgamated Bank. They formed a new SEIU affiliate called Workers United. In 2009, UNITE HERE re-affiliated with the AFL-CIO. UNITE HERE local unions in larger cities were typically organized on a craft basis, with separate organizations for job classifications such as cooks, waitresses, waiters, bartenders and hotel employees. Where separate craft local unions existed, there was often a Local Joint Executive Board which coordinated between the craft locals. UNITE HERE! Local 8 was formed in 2004 as a result of the merger of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE) and the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE). It represents workers in the hospitality industry in Oregon and Washington. Local 8 of the Hotel, Motel and Restaurant Employees Union was formed in 1984 by a merger of Puget Sound-area locals 3, 33, 487, 551, and 596. Other local unions in Washington and Oregon later merged into Local 8 as well.
=520  2\$aUnion records in this collection consist primarily of meeting minutes, membership records, and financial records. The membership records are mainly in the form of dues ledgers, which record members' initiation date and dues payments as well as suspension and reinstatement dates and transfers between local unions. In some cases these ledgers record workers' home addresses and employers. These records are organized in record subgroups corresponding to the local organization that created them. Local 8 records in this collection have some overlap with the records of the local unions which merged to form it. Local 8 records include minutes (1974-1979), membership records (1971-1991), financial records (1978-1986), as well as constitutions and bylaws of related local unions (1927-1984). Records from Seattle-area local unions include those from Cooks and Assistants, Local 33 (membership records, 1908-1977); Waitresses, Local 240 (membership records, 1900-1960; financial records, 1963-1970); Dining Room Employees, Local 3 - a merger of the Waiters Local 239 and Waitresses, Local 240 (membership records, 1950-1970); Bartenders Union, Local 487 (meeting minutes, 1942-1971; membership records, 1918-1967; financial records, 1919-1934); and Hotel, Motel and Club Service Employees, Local 551 (membership records, 1947-1970). Records of the Seattle Joint Executive Board include meeting attendance records (1915-1976), financial records (1903-1974), and collective bargaining records (1957-1975). Spokane, Local 400 records include collective bargaining records (1943-1979) and legal records (1980-1983). Tacoma Joint Local Executive Board records include correspondence and legal records (1969-1976). Records from Tacoma, Local 61 include meeting minutes (1902-1979), membership records (1901-1953), financial records (1901-1969) and collective bargaining records (1917-1970). Local 61, together with Bartenders Union, Local 711, merged to form Local 20 in 1979; this organization is represented here by a small group of records. Tacoma Local 61 established the Local 61 Building Corporation to own and manage its union hall in downtown Tacoma, which it purchased in 1945. Records of this corporation include minutes, property and financial records, and correspondence related to the ownership of the building (1945-1976).Other local union records include those from local unions in Aberdeen (Hotel and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders' Union, Local 791), Bellingham (Culinary and Beverage Workers Union, Local 529), Everett (Culinary Workers and Bartenders, Local 451), Bremerton (Cooks and Waiters Culinary Alliance, Local 730), and Renton (Culinary Workers and Bartenders, Local 596).

=545  0\$aThe Washington State Council of Fire Fighters (WSCFF) was founded on September 1, 1939, and represents 130 affiliated local fire fighter unions and more than 6900 affiliated members of the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) within the state. The WSCFF's mission is to provide the best possible working conditions, the safest work environment, and the fairest wages and benefits to fulfill the needs of the men and women in this profession. The council is active on local and national fronts with regard to issues that affect its members. The WSCFF administers several major programs in addition to political action. Education is provided through regional classes and one comprehensive educational seminar per year. An annual Convention is held to elect officers and determine policy and direction of the WSCFF. Legal assistance is provided through direct response financial loans or retention of counsel. Representation is provided when needed and requested for contract negotiations, mediation, interest arbitration, grievance arbitration, and other matters. The WSCFF's Board of Directors is made up of its executive officers and an elected representative from 11 geographic regions (WSCFF districts across the state). Since WSCFF and legislative districts are not the same, there is some overlap whereby WSCFF board members represent multiple legislative districts. The WSCFF is affiliated with the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), Washington State Labor Council (WSLC) and Canadian Labor Congress (CLC).

=545  1\$aFormed in 1957 by a merger of the Washington State Federation of Labor and the Washington State CIO Council, the Washington State Labor Council (WSLC) became the main political and legislative arm of the AFL-CIO in Washington State. With headquarters in Seattle, Washington, the WLSC lobbied to defeat right-to-work initiatives, won an extension of the 40 hour maximum work week, and an expansion of the unemployment insurance system during the late 1950s. In 1966, the Council launched a major new effort, dubbed Project '66, which effectively increased labor's influence and broadened its political agenda by increasing the amount of money that member unions paid to the Council and doubling the WSLC's staff. These changes allowed the WSLC to monitor government agencies and to lobby on additional areas of legislative interest, such as tax reform and consumer protection. The new program did score a few notable victories, including winning limited collective bargaining rights for public employees and broadening the workers' compensation program. Over the years, WLSC officers and staff included: Evan (Ed) Weston, president, 1957-1961; Joe Davis, president, 1962-1980; Marvin Williams, secretary-treasurer, 1959-1980, president, 1985-1993; Lawrence Kenney, research director, 1969-1980, secretary-treasurer, 1980-1985, president, 1985-1993; Louis Stewart, education director, 1967-1982.
=520  2\$aThe AFL-CIO, Washington State Labor Council records primarily cover the early years of this group, which was formed to advocate on behalf of union members and to affect labor laws and related legislation in Washington State.$bThe collection includes correspondence, minutes, administrative files, reports, subject files, audio tapes, videocassettes, ephemera, and artifacts. It includes records from the term of Joe Davis as president (1961-1979), with lesser amounts from the terms of his predecessor, Evan Weston, and his successor, Marvin L. Williams (1979-1986). Also included are records from Williams during his tenure as secretary-treasurer, 1959-1979; together with records of Louis Stewart, education director, from 1967; Sam Kinville, government affairs director, 1967-1974; and Lawrence Kenney, research director, from 1969. Among the other groups that are significantly represented in the records is the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Education.

Paul Chair of Political Science at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington where he taught classes on political theory and U.S. politics. His research focused on Latinx migrant laborers' work experiences, political organizations, and languages of collective action. His books include The Fight for Time: Migrant Day Laborers and the Politics of Precarity (Oxford University Press, 2019), Breaks in the Chain: What Immigrant Workers Can Teach America about Democracy (University of Minnesota Press, 2010), and Stations of the Cross: Adorno and Christian Right Radio (Duke University Press, 2000). Paul is co-editor of Public Affairs: Politics in the Age of Sex Scandals (Duke University Press, 2005). His current research explores neoliberal power relations via an analysis of work experiences and political organizing among migrant day laborers.
=520  2\$aThe collection contains interviews and research materials created and gathered by Paul Apostolidis which formed the basis for his 2010 book Breaks in the Chain: What Immigrant Workers Can Teach America about Democracy. Paper-based research materials include print transcriptions, newspaper articles, scholarly papers, materials from courses taught by Apostolidis at Whitman College, legal records, and correspondence with Teamsters, Tyson, and research team members. Audiovisual material consists primarily of original recordings on audiocassettes and minicassettes of about 40 interviews with immigrant meatpacking workers in Pasco who were members of International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 556 (the local represented workers at the Tyson/IBP beef plant in Wallula, Washington just outside Pasco; in 2005, Tyson destroyed the union through company-engineered decertification elections). Other audiovisual materials include VHS tapes, a DVD of news coverage, and depositions of employees.
=506  \\$aNo restrictions on access for paper-based materials; however, no user access copy is currently available for VHS tapes and audiocassette. Users may obtain a reproduction of the media for a fee by contacting Special Collections. Access to VHS tapes and interview audiocassette is restricted. An appointment with the Labor Archives curator is required prior to viewing. Contact UW Special Collections for more details or to request an appointment.

=520  2\$aAutobiographical and fictional writings by Kevin Castle about her role as a pioneering woman in the longshore industry. The collection contains a long-form personal memoir account, "The Longshoreman's Daughter," poems including "Rare", "Breaking out Containers in the Port of Seattle", "Crane Operator 1: The Climb", and "Crane Operator 2: The Drive". Her historical fiction includes: "The Shape Up", 1983; "Strike Headquarters", 1983; and "Smith Cove", 1983. All of these stories were written in 1983 based on contemporary newspaper accounts of the 1934 Pacific Coast Maritime Strike.
=545  0\$aKevin Castle was born in 1952 in Coos Bay, Oregon. Her family had moved there during the McCarthy Era "red scare" when progressive trade union organizers and a members of the Communist Party like here father, Del Castle, were being targeted by the US government for special scrutiny and persecution. Labor organizations and their leaders alike were systematically harassed and surveilled by the FBI. Due to this political context, Kevin's family was living under an assumed name in Coos Bay. When it was safer, the family emerged from hiding and moved to Seattle. Kevin attended some of the few integrated schools in the city, graduating from Garfield High School in 1970. She became involved in anti-Vietnam War activities, and took a year off from school to travel throughout South America before attending the University of Washington. During her time at the UW, Kevin continued her anti-war activism and co-founded the Seattle Tenant Union before graduating in 1979 with a BA in history. During summers in college, Kevin had begun working as a casual waterfront worker. In 1980, she was hired along with a group of twelve other women who were the first to work in the Port of Seattle. After gaining enough seniority to train, she became the first woman cargo crane operator in Seattle, and worked as a crane operator until her retirement in 2005. Kevin worked on many of these stories and poems after her retirement.

=545  0\$aJim Douglas is an attorney who has practiced Social Security disability law since 1978. Douglas was part of a legal team working for the families of slain Seattle labor unionists Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes in a civil suit against Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos for orchestrating the 1981 assassinations of the union reformers in their Pioneer Square office. The two men had been working with an international community in opposition of the dictator, who had cracked down on the political left and trade unions in the Philippines when we seized power and declared martial law. In December of 1989, a jury found that Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos were responsible for the murders and awarded {dollar}15 million to the families of Domingo and Viernes. This marked the first time that a foreign dictator was held responsible for crimes committed in the United States. Douglas was also a co-founder of the Seattle chapter of Line of March, a Marxist-Leninist national political organization in the 1980s dedicated to peace and social justice.
=520  2\$aRecords created and collected by Douglas as part of a legal team working for the families of Domingo and Viernes in their civil suit against Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos.

=545  1\$aThe Union of Democratic Filipinos / Katipunan ng mga Demokratikong Pilipino (KDP) is an organization that emerged in the Filipino American Community in 1973. As an organization the KDP embraced the dual goal of establishing socialism in the US, as well as supporting the National Democratic Movement led by the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). A central part of the mission of the KDP was fighting the regime of Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who had established marshall law when he seized power and represssed leftists and trade unionists in the Philippines. Two of the KDP's Seattle members, Gene Viernes and Silme Domingo, were assassinated for their attempts to counter the Marcos regime and reform the Cannery Workers Union is Seattle. Marcos was later found guilty of orchestrating the attacks and found criminally liable in a US court.
=520  2\$aRecords, publications, photographic slides, and research files collected by the KDP in its activities. The collection also contains some materials on the history of the organization and its members.

=545  1\$aThe SeaTac Seattle Minimum Wage History Project is a research, archival documentation, and oral history project co-directed by University of Washington political science professor Michael McCann and University of Washington labor archivist Conor Casey. Beginning in 2015, the project members--McCann, Casey, and graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Washington--collected articles about the SeaTac and Seattle camaigns and then peformed dozens oral history interviews. As well, some hard copy archival collections were collected for the Labor Archives of Washington, websites were archivally captured, and some materials were digitized relating to the campaigns. The resulting digital web archive documents the stories of those involved in the campaigns, as supporters and opponents, in or affected by the struggles over a {dollar}15 minimum wage at SeaTac and in Seattle as well as the broader, ongoing effects and efforts at a national level. Interviews include a broad coalition of labor union officers and members, politicians, nonprofit community partners, and small business owners in support and against the initiatives.
=520  2\$aAudio and video files of oral history interviews of the collection, full transcriptions of interviews in PDF and print format, archived websites, PDF exports of newspaper and journal articles on the SeaTac and Seattle campaigns, including research on the history of minimum wage laws, local media coverage, and national media coverage.

=545  1\$aLeft Bank Books was founded in 1973 by a group of workers who split off from the University District's Red and Black Books to form their own collective bookstore in the Pike Place Market. The two projects continued as separate but mutually supportive projects until the mid 1990s, when Red and Black closed. For much of the 1980s and 1990s, the Left Bank Books Collective expanded to include two other projects: AKA Books, a used bookstore in Seattle's University District, as well as a wholesale distribution and mail order project known as Left Bank Distribution. Neither of these projects exists today due to financial problems and rental situations in Seattle. Left Bank is collectively owned and operated by its workers, and has been since its inception. As an anarchist collective, Left Bank has no bosses or managers. Decisions are made in bi-monthly collective meetings based on a consensus process. Left Bank Books still operates out of a Pike Place Market storefront. Left Bank Books was founded as a small collective. In the late 1990s, Left Bank Books became registered as a federal corporation so that in the event of financial difficulty at the store, individual employees would not be held financially responsible. Left Bank Books is not federally registered as a non-profit. Left Bank Distribution, or LBD, was a project started by the Left Bank Books collective in 1980 and ended in 2001. LBD was a book distribution project that provided direct mail-order service of radical book, zines and magazines to individuals and bookstores during the 1980s and 1990s. LBD was a wholesale distributor of radical and alternative books, pamphlets, magazines and zines to independent bookstores, tabling projects, libraries and other organizations, and individuals, mail order catalog. LBD offered one of the largest selections of anarchist & radical books in the world. Corporatization of the bookstore and distribution industry beginning in the late 1990s led to the proliferation of chain bookstores and put many independent bookstores out of business.

=545  1\$aRIDGE was a community organization in Roslyn, Washington formed in 1988 by school teachers Doug Johnson and Susan Willis Johnson. Ellie Belew and Douglas Kilgore were leaders of the organization, which engaged in activism around forestry and land use issues during the late 1980s and into the early 2010s. RIDGE partnered with labor groups-- especially the building trades unions-- in a long fight to block the development of what is now the Suncadia Resort, the first Master Planned Resort in Washington State. Master Planned Resort [MPR] is a type of zoning distinction defined by the Washington State Growth Management [GMA] Act. MPRs are self-contained and fully integrated planned unit developments, in a setting of significant natural amenities, with primary focus on destination resort facilities consisting of short-term visitor accommodations associated with a range of developed on-site indoor or outdoor recreational facilities. The plan allows urban development outside of urban areas and connection to municipal wastewater connections but requires the MPR to be separated from surrounding communities. RIDGE used a variety of tactics to attempt to block Suncadia's development including: litigation, land use mapping, water rights, community meetings, and zoning changes. Later, RIDGE engaged with Futurewise to litigate and organize for reforms to the Kittitas County Comprehensive Plan. RIDGE dissolved in 2014.

Rieder served as president of the Pacific Northwest Labor History Association for 37 years from 1978 to 2015, and remains a member and active supporter of the PNLHA. Before retiring, Rieder was a music teacher and a member of the Everett American Federation of Teachers local union. Rieder also worked for the the Snohomish County Central Labor Council and Washington State Federation of Labor. Other achievements by Rieder during his career in labor include his co-leadership (with Will Parry) of a Washington State Labor Council campaign in 1978-1979 to assist King County unions to organize workers in picketing automobile dealerships in reaction to a growing trend among the dealerships to open their shops to non-union work. Parry and Ross paired again to organize the Washington State delegation of union members and supporters for Solidarity Day -- a rally against the Reagan administration initiated by the AFL-CIO Executive Council and held in Washington, D.C., on September 19, 1981. Later, Rieder co-hosted a labor radio show on KSER (Everett) called "Part of the Union" between and served as president of the AFT retiree chapter in Washington.

=545  0\$aTyree Scott, a Texas-born electrician who served in the Marines during the Vietnam War, settled in Seattle in 1966. Discrimination against black workers in the construction trades led him to organize peaceful demonstrations, and in 1970 he co-founded the United Construction Workers Association with support from the American Friends Service Committee. The UCWA aimed to unite minority construction workers and racially integrate the unions. An early victory came in 1970, when Judge William J. Lindberg found that racial discrimination had been practiced in local unions (United States vs. Ironworkers Local 86, et al). Scott also served on the board of the Northwest Labor and Employment Law Office (LELO), which was begun in 1973 by the UCWA, the Alaska Cannery Workers Association, and the Washington State United Farm Workers to help workers pursue legal recourse in issues of labor discrimination.
=520  2\$aContains correspondence, minutes, financial reports, manpower compliance reports, subject files, newsletters, speeches and writings, published materials, and other materials documenting the efforts of the United Construction Workers Association to integrate the building trades. Also includes case files, correspondence, minutes, and other records of the Northwest Labor and Employment Law Office, Court Order Advisory Committee, Southwestern Workers' Federation, Organizing Committee for an Ideological Center, and the American Friends Service Committee Pacific Northwest Regional Office.

=545  1\$aTemporary Workers of America (TWA) was officially incorporated in 2014 with 38 members, winning an NLRB election and the right to bargain. It was the first known independent union created entirely by temporary workers. Founded by eventual TWA president Philippe Boucher and a small group of fellow permatemps working to test foreign language apps. They were employees of Lionbridge, a company sub-contracted by Microsoft. The union was formed to demand basic paid time off and argued for joint employment from Microsoft and its contractor, Lionbridge. Microsoft eventually outsourced the work and closed the Washington State Lionbridge office. The Union dissolved after the office closed in 2019.

=545  1\$aThe Staff Rights Organizing Committee (SROC) mobilized University of Washington employees to fight a discriminatory job reclassification, which resulted in a strike at the University of Washington in 1973. After the strike, members of the SROC formed their own union, United Workers Union-Independent (UWU-I). The union raised issues about the effects of racism and sexism on salaries which later became the concept of the Comparable Worth campaign. UWU-I's advocacy for low-paid, unorganized women and people of color on campus prodded other campus unions to better represent those workers.

=545  1\$aWashington Committee for Occupational Safety and Health (WashCOSH) was founded in 1992 at a meeting of union and safety and health activists at the International Association of Machinists, Lodge 751 union hall. The goal was to improve workplace safety and health. Funding came from subcontracting on grants to the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees and the Alice Hamilton Committee for Safety and Health from the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences. WashCOSH was involved in various projects over its history, including Ergonomics at a Buffalo Industries fabric recycling plant organized by Teamsters. The organization also offered a program of Painting Hazards Certification Training and other "painters' upgrade classes" for the Painters Advanced Training Institute at the Duwamish Branch of South Seattle Community College. Other trainings included Confined Space Entry Training and Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Training for the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees. As well, the organization was involved with annual Workers' Memorial Day Events. WashCOSH published a quarterly newsletter, a guide called "Pollution Prevention for Construction Painting: A guide to help protect painters, the public and the environment" and organized an annual conferences including "Ergonomics, Safety, and Health in Construction, September 12-13, 1994" and "A Labor Union Response to Violence in the Workplace, June 10th, 1995" WashCOSH created a multi-organizational governance committee, the WISHA Workplace Violence Committee. The executive board was made up of representatives from many unions, including Diane Zahn from the United Food and Commercial Workers (the first board president); Bill Anderson of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (Board President); Roger Yockey of United Food and Commercial Workers; and Jay Herzmark (Trustee, Board President) of AFSCME. Other unions represented on the board included International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Office and Professional Employees International Union. The first employee of WashCOSH was Anna Bachmann, who was hired as the Training Director in April 1993. She was later joined by Mark Catlin in the summer of 1993, who was the Director/Industrial Hygienist. Jay Herzmark replaced Catlin at the beginning of 1998. WashCOSH went out of business in the summer of 1998 because of tax issues.
=520  2\$aThese materials were collected by Jay Herzmark during his work with the Washington Committee for Occupational Safety and Health (WashCOSH). During his time with WashCOSH, Herzmark served as training director, trustee, and board president. Materials include a banner reading "WashCOSH: Organizing for SAFETY & HEALTH". Bumper stickers advocating worker health and safety, a listing of the board of directors and staff, materials from conferences and trainings including programs, an overview brochure on the organization, and an issue of WashCOSH's newsetter from 1995.

=545  0\$aMichael Withey is a Seattle-based lawyer who served as a representing attorney in the Domingo v Marcos court case. He is a public interest lawyer who has made a career representing the "little guy" against powerful interests to protect constitutional rights, civil rights, and human rights for the past 42 years. He is the former president of the Public Justice Foundation and received numerous prestigious awards. Gene Viernes was born in Yakima on August 16, 1951, the eldest of nine children born to Felix and Betty Viernes. Felix had emigrated from the Philippines in the 1920s. He was a fruit picker and also worked in canneries. His son Gene grew up picking fruit before going to school. Gene joined Local 37, ILWU in 1966 at the age of 14, after lying about his age and paying a {dollar}50 bribe to a cannery foreman. He spent many summers as an "Alaskero," working in the Alaskan salmon canneries along with his father and brothers. In the 1970s, he met Silme Domingo and they became close friends. Together they formed the Alaska Cannery Workers' Association, a workers' legal advocacy group. Within Local 37, Gene Viernes played a crucial role in the formation of the Rank and File Committee, the group that spearheaded the reform movement in 1977. Silme Domingo was born in Killeen, Texas, on January 25, 1952. His father had emigrated from the Philippines in the 1920s, and had joined the Army and fought in the Pacific during World War II. Silme was the third of five children born to Nemesio and Adelina Domingo. He grew up in Texas and Germany in accordance with his father's military career, and the family moved to Seattle in 1960. Silme attended Ballard High School and graduated with honors from the University of Washington. Silme, following his parents' social activism, participated in the effort during the 1970s to save Seattle's International District, and joined the work to establish social services for people in the district. In 1974 Silme joined the Union of Democratic Filipino (KDP) and established the Seattle KDP chapter, which organized the first protest in Seattle against the Marcos dictatorship. He was best known for his work in the Alaska Cannery Workers Union. He was survived by two children, Ligaya and Kalayaan.

=545  1\$aOn June 1, 1981, Seattle-based Filipino American labor activists Gene Viernes (1951-1981) and Silme Domingo (1952-1981) of Local 37 of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union(ILWU) are murdered near Pioneer Square in downtown Seattle. They were attempting to reform the union, which they thought was corrupt, and were calling for better working conditions in the canneries. The murders were originally thought to be an isolated act of violence, but friends and family organized a Committee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes (CJDV) eventually found links between the murders to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda, who had ordered the murders in retaliation for the victims' anti-Marcos organizing. In 1989, and a federal jury agreed with the CJDV, finding Marcos guilty of the murders.[Source: https://www.historylink.org/File/412; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silme_Domingo]
=520  2\$aDocuments, including depositions, court documents, drafts, notes, exhibits, and other material, tapes, video, and photographs relating to Michael Withey's role as a representing attorney in the Doming v. Marcos court case. The case came as a result of the 1981 assassination Seattle labor leaders Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes in a plot involving Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos and a Seattle union leader Tony Baruso. Domingo and Viernes, in addition to serving as cannery union officers, had been organizing as part of a Filipinx diaspora organization to oppose the Marcos Regime. After the murders, a Committee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes was formed and a legal case against Marcos made its way through the US judicial system.

=545  1\$aThe Freedom Socialist party is a revolutionary socialist feminist organization that does intersectional organizing against racism, sexism, homophobia, and labor exploitation. The FSP's political analysis sees women's leadership and political action as decisive to social change and trains women to lead in these campaigns. The immediate forerunner of the Freedom Socialist Party began with the Kirk-Kaye tendency within the Socialist Workers Party, led by Dick Fraser (Kirk) and Clara Fraser (Kaye) who were married at the time. The Kirk-Kaye tendency had a distinct analysis on civil rights, derived from the theory of "revolutionary integrationism," and took a more sympathetic towards China as a worker's state than the SWP. The Freedom Socialist Party was founded in 1966, and had a differing analysis from the SWP's on black nationalist views of Malcolm X and the SWP's orientation toward the labor leaders rather than rank and file workers, and its relationships to the anti-Vietnam War movement, and its dismissive attitude toward the emerging feminist movement. The FSP advocated class solidarity between black and white workers, centered their revolutionary analysis around women's emancipation, and urged the anti-war movement to support the socialist, anti-colonial aims of the Vietnamese Revolution. FSP leaders Clara Fraser (1923-1998) and Gloria Martin (1916-1995) built on the socialist analysis of women's oppression to create a Leninist party that is "socialist-feminist" in ideology and practice. The party views the liberation struggles of women, people of color and sexual minorities (such as gay people) as intrinsic to working-class revolt, and it looks to these specially-oppressed sectors of society to provide revolutionary leadership. Women comprise a predominant part of the party leadership. Overall, membership is diverse and is composed of all genders and races. The party characterizes its National Comrades of Color Caucus as offering the party's diverse ranks of people of color an opportunity to work together as a team to grow as leaders and provide direction for the party's work in people of color movements. The party has branches in a number of U.S. cities, as well as one in Melbourne, Australia. The Freedom Socialist newspaper is produced six times a year. Red Letter Press publishes books and pamphlets for the party. The FSP is affiliated with Radical Women, which is an autonomous socialist feminist organization.

=545  1\$aMark Dworkin and Melissa Young began Moving Images in 1986 to tell the stories of ordinary people. Moving Images Video Project produces and distributes documentaries about war and peace, human rights, global justice, and protection for the environment. Founded by Young and Dworkin to increase understanding in the United States of political and social issues in Central America, Moving Images later expanded to address the AIDS epidemic, labor rights and childcare, international relations in the post cold-war era, implications of new genetic technologies, local food and farming, re-thinking our cities, and elements of a new economy that is more sustainable and just. Many of these programs have aired across North America on PBS, and they are widely distributed to schools, libraries, and community organizations. Text of organizational history derived from Moving Images website (http://movingimages.org).
